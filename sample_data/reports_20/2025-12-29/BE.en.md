### Key Risks

1. High beta (3.00) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-2.0% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Heavy insider selling: $21M sold (12 transactions in 90 days).
4. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.2x requires aggressive growth execution.
5. Elevated short interest (11.3%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

Analyst sentiment positive (1 raises, avg +16%). Insider selling cluster ($20.8M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -7.5% to -9.5% (-2.0% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 13.5pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -9.2% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 10.3pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.61x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 43. Volume at 36% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +SUL (Resistance test).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
