- Morgan Stanley trimmed its price target for Amgen (AMGN) from $329 to $304, maintaining an Equal Weight rating, citing easing policy risks for the biopharma industry in 2026. This comes after Amgen announced a 6% increase in its quarterly dividend, marking 15 consecutive years of increases, and reported strong Q3 2025 results with a 12% revenue jump and 14% volume growth.

- Amgen recently received FDA approval for an expanded label for UPLIZNA, now including adults with generalized myasthenia gravis who are anti-AChR and anti-MuSK antibody positive. This approval strengthens Amgen's position in rare autoimmune diseases, offering a differentiated b-cell therapy with low-frequency dosing. While this expands Amgen's rare-disease reach, the company still faces challenges from biosimilar erosion and drug pricing pressures, though a recent dividend increase signals management's confidence in cash flow durability.
