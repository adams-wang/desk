### Key Risks

1. High beta (3.00) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_10 falling (-6.8% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Heavy insider selling: $12M sold (9 transactions in 90 days).
4. Valuation stretched: PEG 5.0x requires aggressive growth execution.
5. Elevated short interest (11.1%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

Analyst sentiment positive (1 raises, avg +50%). Insider selling cluster ($12.5M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).
