While companies like GRAIL are pushing for wider adoption and Medicare coverage, the medical community expresses concerns due to limited research on their effectiveness and potential for false positives or a false sense of security.

Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
