**1. Iris Energy Shares Extend Decline Amid Funding Concerns**
- Source: AD HOC NEWS | 20251217T210839 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Iris Energy (IREN) shares have significantly declined following concerns about a substantial funding gap required to fulfill its multi-billion dollar GPU cloud contract with Microsoft, despite an initial surge in early November. This decline is exacerbated by a major investor, Paul Tudor Jones, reducing his stake, and broader pressures from both the Bitcoin mining and AI sectors. The market awaits the company's quarterly report on February 11, 2026, for clarity on its capital deployment plans.

**2. Paul Tudor Jones Trims IREN After 300% Run, AI Story Still Intact - IREN (NASDAQ:IREN)**
- Source: Benzinga | 20251215T160937 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Paul Tudor Jones's Tudor Investment fund significantly reduced its stake in IREN after the stock surged 300%, locking in substantial profits, yet the company's AI narrative remains strong due to a major contract with Microsoft. Despite recent capital raises for expansion causing minor dilution concerns, IREN's market momentum continues, suggesting Jones's move was profit-taking rather than a lack of confidence. The company’s pivot from crypto mining to AI cloud and GPU services is highlighted by its multi-year, multi-billion dollar deal with Microsoft.
