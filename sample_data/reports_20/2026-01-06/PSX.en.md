- Phillips 66 has won a UK government-supervised sale for the Lindsey refinery and its associated assets, which were under court orders for the liquidation of several Prax Group businesses. The company plans to integrate these acquisitions into its Humber refinery to enhance operations and fuel supply to UK customers, while not restarting standalone refinery operations at Lindsey due to its unviability. The acquisition is subject to regulatory clearances and aims to secure jobs and bolster the local economy.

**4. Phillips 66 (PSX) Moves 7.2% Higher: Will This Strength Last?**

- Phillips 66 (PSX) shares increased by 7.2% to $139.98 in the last trading session, driven by improved refining segment execution, higher utilization rates, and cost-efficiency initiatives. Despite this rally, the consensus EPS estimate for the upcoming quarter has been marginally revised lower, which typically does not lead to price appreciation. However, the stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

- Source: Pipeline and Gas Journal | 20260105T200836 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Phillips 66 has acquired assets from the now-liquidated Lindsey Oil Refinery in the UK, choosing to integrate them into its Humber Refinery operations rather than restarting the Lindsey refinery as a standalone facility. The company stated that the Lindsey site is unviable in its current form for refining operations. This move aims to improve supply flexibility and support both traditional and renewable fuel production at Humber, though it creates uncertainty for the remaining employees at the former Lindsey site.
