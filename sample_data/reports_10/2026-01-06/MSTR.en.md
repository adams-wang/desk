### Key Risks

1. High beta (3.43) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation risk: PEG 3.1x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
3. Elevated short interest (10.9%): bears positioning against stock.
4. Long-term trend broken: trading 50.4% below SMA200.
5. Falling knife pattern: rapid decline without stabilization, catch risk elevated.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | RISK_ON (MEDIUM) | 1.10x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*RISK_ON regime with strong participation and low volatility. VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) with breadth at 63.5% signals healthy risk appetite. Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
