### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.54) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Heavy insider selling: $15M sold (24 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 142.9x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Elevated short interest (8.4%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 142.86 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (13.6x). Revenue growth strong at 183% YoY. Insider selling cluster ($14.6M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 3 selling).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
