**1. Enact Holdings (ACT): Assessing Valuation After Recent Share Price Momentum**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251202T161300 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Enact Holdings (ACT) shares have seen recent momentum, gaining nearly 9% in a month and 20% year-to-date, with a 79% total return over three years. Despite this, the company is considered to be undervalued, trading slightly below analysts' fair value estimates, driven by strong homebuyer demand and home price appreciation. However, persistently high mortgage rates could negatively impact its outlook.
