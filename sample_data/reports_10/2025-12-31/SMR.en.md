- Source: ts2.tech | 20251229T110954 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- NuScale Power's stock closed down 7.7% at $14.85, driven by investor concerns over potential dilution. This follows the approval to double authorized Class A shares to 662 million and an existing at-the-market stock sale program for up to $750 million. The company requires additional capital to fund operations as it has not yet commercialized its NuScale Power Modules.

|-------|--------|----------|

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
