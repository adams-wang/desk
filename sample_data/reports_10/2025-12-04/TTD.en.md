- Nexxen International's fair value estimate has been cut from $14.84 to $12.34 per share, reflecting a more conservative outlook despite stable perceived risk. While some analysts maintain bullish stances due to strong Q3 performance and an integrated platform, others are cautious due to guidance resets, changing DSP partner spend, and broader ad weakness, leading to lower price targets across the board. The company's focus on returning capital via a share buyback and expanding CTV offerings signals strategic moves amidst evolving market conditions.
