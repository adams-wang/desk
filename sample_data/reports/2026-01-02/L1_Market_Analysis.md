**Conflicts & Divergences**
- VIX near 52-week lows (complacency) while breadth is deteriorating slightly - potential divergence
- Rising Treasury yields (Goldman news) vs Fed rate-cut expectations - market may be pricing conflicting narratives
- Put/Call at 0.885 (neutral-low) suggests limited hedging despite year-start uncertainty

**Positioning Guidance**
- Regime: NORMAL (STABLE)
- Confidence: HIGH
- Position size: 120% max
- Key action: Maintain positions with standard sizing; no adjustment needed ahead of Jan 9 jobs data.

**Triggers**
- Upgrade: VIX sustained below 13 with breadth above 60% would suggest RISK_ON, Dovish jobs data (Jan 9) confirming Fed cut path, Strong earnings beats from financials mid-January
- Downgrade: VIX spike above 20 with breadth below 45%, Hot jobs data forcing Fed to pause cuts, Geopolitical shock or policy surprise

**Risk Factors**
- Complacency risk with VIX at 4th percentile - limited room for further compression
- Jobs data (Jan 9) is key catalyst that could shift rate expectations
- Earnings season concentration risk - financials kick off Jan 15
- Regulatory/policy uncertainty (offshore wind lawsuits signal potential friction)
