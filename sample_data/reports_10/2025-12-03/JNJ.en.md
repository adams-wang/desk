- Guggenheim reaffirmed a Buy rating and $206 price target on Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) following positive clinical trial data for its multiple myeloma therapy. The MajesTEC-3 trial, combining Tecvayli and Darzalex, showed "overwhelmingly positive" results, potentially setting a new treatment standard.

**2. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock News & Forecast: EU Drug Approval, $3B Cancer Deal and Dividend Strength – December 1, 2025**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251201T160623 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 99%
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stock is trading near record highs in December 2025, driven by strong performance, EU approval for its novel gMG drug IMAAVY (nipocalimab), and strategic acquisitions like Halda Therapeutics for $3.05 billion. The company reported solid Q3 2025 earnings and raised full-year guidance, reinforcing its status as a Dividend Aristocrat with a reliable, growing dividend. Despite strong fundamentals and positive sentiment, most analyst price targets suggest limited near-term upside after a ~47% YTD rally, and talc litigation remains a significant risk factor.

- Johnson & Johnson's Imaavy (nipocalimab) has received EU approval for treating generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in both adolescent and adult patients, making it the first FcRn blocker cleared for adolescents in Europe. This approval is based on positive results from the phase 3 Vivacity-MG3 and phase 2/3 Vibrance-MG studies, positioning Imaavy to compete with existing treatments from Argenx and UCB, while also having received approval in the US, Brazil, and Japan. J&J acquired nipocalimab through its 2020 acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals, and the drug is being explored for multiple other autoimmune conditions with a projected annual sales potential of $5 billion.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
