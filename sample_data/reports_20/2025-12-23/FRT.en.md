- Agree Realty (ADC) recently announced a 3.6% annualized dividend increase, bringing attention to its valuation. Despite trading below analyst targets and showing steady double-digit revenue and earnings growth, its high P/E ratio suggests a premium valuation compared to peers. The market's current assessment of ADC's future growth and e-commerce resistant tenant base is being scrutinized.

- Curbline Properties (CURB) recently declared a regular fourth-quarter dividend and a special dividend, signaling strong cash generation.
