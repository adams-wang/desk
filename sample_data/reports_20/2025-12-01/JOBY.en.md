### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.54) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-1.7% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Heavy insider selling: $15M sold (24 transactions in 90 days).
4. Valuation stretched: PEG 142.9x requires aggressive growth execution.
5. Elevated short interest (8.4%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 142.86 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (13.6x). Revenue growth strong at 183% YoY. Insider selling cluster ($14.6M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 3 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -6.5% to -8.1% (-1.7% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 12.1pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -7.2% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 6.7pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.17x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 41. Volume at 39% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.
