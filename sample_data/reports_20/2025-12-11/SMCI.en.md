-  Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock has dropped to around $34, down 40% from its 2025 peak, reflecting investor skepticism due to repeated earnings misses and gross-margin compression, despite strong AI-server demand. The company missed Q1 FY2026 revenue expectations due to configuration delays and data-center constraints, leading to a significant drop in EPS. Maintaining a bullish bias, analysts project an upside towards $55 if gross margins rebound above 10%, emphasizing that margin trajectory, not topline growth, will determine SMCI's fair value.
