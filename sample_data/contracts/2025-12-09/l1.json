While VIX remains contained at 16.93 (44th percentile), the elevated put/call ratio at 1.08 and weak breadth at 47.6% reveal a more nuanced picture. The 21% spike in put/call over 5 days suggests institutional hedging despite calm volatility - a classic divergence indicating smart money caution.\n\nThe yield curve remains healthy at +55bps, supporting risk assets, while economic indicators show stability with Fed funds at 4.09% and unemployment at 4.4%. However, the narrow breadth signals concentration risk, with fewer stocks participating in any rally.\n\nNews themes support this mixed picture: AI/semiconductor momentum (Micron, Intel-Tata) shows sector leadership, but broader corporate guidance remains cautious (Home Depot's muted outlook). M&A activity (Netflix-Warner Bros) creates volatility but also suggests confidence in select sectors.\n\nThe key conflict is between surface calm (VIX) and underlying caution (put/call, breadth). This suggests a market that appears stable but lacks broad conviction. Position sizing should reflect this selectivity, favoring quality names over broad exposure until breadth improves or volatility normalizes the hedging demand.",
