- Live Nation and Ticketmaster have asked a federal judge to dismiss the US Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit regarding ticket resales, calling it "agency overreach" and arguing the FTC is trying to rewrite the BOTS Act. They contend the lawsuit fails to demonstrate Ticketmaster violated the BOTS Act or was aware of any circumvention methods used by brokers. Live Nation maintains its incentives are aligned with artists and fans, and that ticket resales constitute only a small fraction of its revenue.

### Market Context

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
