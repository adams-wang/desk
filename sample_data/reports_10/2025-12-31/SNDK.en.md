- In 2025, the artificial intelligence investment landscape shifted dramatically, with "boring" companies providing data center infrastructure outperforming traditional tech giants. Data storage companies like Sandisk Corp., Western Digital Corp., and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc took the top spots on the S&P 500, while AI chipmaker Nvidia saw more modest gains. This trend highlights a broader investor pivot towards the "picks and shovels" supporting the AI boom, including power, cooling, wiring, and construction providers for data centers, and even Bitcoin miners retooling for high-performance computing.
