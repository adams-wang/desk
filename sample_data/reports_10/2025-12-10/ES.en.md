-  Some Eversource customers are expressing concern over significantly higher estimated electric bills, attributing the spikes to newly installed smart meters. One Springfield resident, Margaret Tebaldi, received an estimated bill of $720-$800 after a zero bill following a previous $200 charge, despite being on a fixed income.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
