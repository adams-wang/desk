This decision by the California Public Utilities Commission highlights the conflict between the state's need for grid fortification against wildfires and the associated costs often passed to consumers.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251218T154826 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- PG&E (PCG) has recently seen a 6% increase in its share price, outperforming the broader utilities sector, despite its year-to-date returns remaining negative. The company's valuation suggests it is undervalued with a fair value around $21.23, driven by potential growth in grid modernization and wildfire mitigation investments, as well as a lower-than-average P/E ratio compared to its sector. However, persistent wildfire liability and affordability pressures in California pose risks to this bullish outlook.
