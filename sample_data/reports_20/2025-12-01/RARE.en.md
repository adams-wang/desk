- Source: Sahm | 20251201T042432 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 98%
-  Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical (RARE) has seen renewed investor optimism and a 16% 90-day share price return due to analyst commentary on its setrusumab program, strong revenue growth, and advancing late-stage drug candidates. Despite a 12-month total shareholder return of -27%, analysts widely consider the stock undervalued, with a fair value of $83.40 compared to its current price of $34.75. The company's robust clinical pipeline, including five Phase III programs and upcoming BLA submissions and data readouts, is expected to significantly accelerate revenue growth.
