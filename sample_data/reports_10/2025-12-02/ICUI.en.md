**1. ICU Medical, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ICUI) Share Price Boosted 27% But Its Business Prospects Need A Lift Too**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251201T041120 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  ICU Medical, Inc.'s shares have seen a 27% increase recently, but despite this boost, the company's P/S ratio of 1.6x remains low compared to the Medical Equipment industry. This is attributed to the company's declining revenue growth, which significantly lags behind the industry average. Analysts forecast only 2.8% annual revenue growth for ICU Medical over the next three years, compared to 133% for the rest of the industry, suggesting a less prosperous future and justifying the lower valuation.
