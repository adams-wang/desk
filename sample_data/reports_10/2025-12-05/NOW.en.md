-  ServiceNow is acquiring Veza, an AI-native identity security provider, to expand its security and risk portfolio and address the increasing complexity of enterprise identities due to AI adoption. This acquisition is expected to bolster ServiceNow's top-line growth, although its subscription revenue growth guidance for 2025 indicates a slower pace than previous years, partly due to tightening U.S. federal agency budgets. The company also faces strong competition from Atlassian and Salesforce, and its stock has underperformed the sector and appears overvalued based on its forward price/sales.
