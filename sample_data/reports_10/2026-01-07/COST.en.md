**1. Costco stock slips ahead of December sales report after the bell**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260107T200827 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Costco Wholesale shares fell about 0.5% in afternoon trading as investors awaited the retailer's December sales update. This monthly release serves as a quick check-in after the holiday season, with traders focusing on comparable sales and membership momentum, which are key drivers of Costco's profitability. Analysts will be looking for signs of continued U.S. traffic and also considering the impact of gasoline prices and currency fluctuations on the overall sales picture.

**2. Costco stock rises on Mizuho upgrade as December sales report nears**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260107T002752 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Costco Wholesale Corp. shares rose after a Mizuho upgrade to "Outperform" and inclusion on its Top Picks list, with the analyst raising the price target to $1,000 from $950. The upgrade comes as investors anticipate Costco's December sales report due on Wednesday, which will offer insights into comparable sales, margins, and membership momentum. Despite some investor wariness about tougher comparisons and cost pressures, Mizuho's thesis suggests recent worries about slowing membership and comparable sales growth are overstated, citing strong renewal rates and growth in premium memberships.

**3. Is Costco Stock Set to Rebound Higher in 2026?**
- Source: Finviz | 20260106T131201 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) stock faced a "rare weak stretch" in 2025 despite strong business growth, including an 8.2% rise in total sales and 14% growth in membership fee income in fiscal Q1 2026. The article questions whether Costco's stock, currently trading at a high valuation of 47 times earnings, is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued, suggesting that the lofty price leaves little room for error and could lead to underperformance. Despite the company's solid fundamentals, the author indicates a preference to stay on the sidelines due to valuation concerns.

**4. Costco stock climbs on Mizuho’s $1,000 call as December sales report nears**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260106T003338 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Costco Wholesale Corp shares surged after Mizuho upgraded the stock and set a $1,000 price target, signaling confidence in the warehouse retailer ahead of its December sales report. The upgrade highlights Costco's fundamental strengths like membership-fee growth, steady traffic, and pricing power, despite recent stock retreats and concerns about potential sales cannibalization from new store openings. The upcoming December sales results on January 7th will offer a critical snapshot of post-holiday demand and influence future growth and valuation debates.

**5. Costco Stock Rises After Mizuho Upgrade and Top Pick Designation**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20260105T171456 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Costco (COST) shares rose about 1% in premarket trading after Mizuho upgraded the stock to Outperform and named it a Top Pick for 2026, arguing that concerns over slowing growth are exaggerated. Mizuho analyst David Bellinger increased the price target to $1,000, citing strong membership growth, high renewal rates, and anticipated profit boosts from lower labor pressures and high single-digit sales growth. He also suggested the potential for another special dividend in fiscal 2027 due to Costco's healthy financial position.

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
