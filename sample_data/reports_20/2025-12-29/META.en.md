**1. Constellation Energy studies deployment of next-generation nuclear technology at Illinois Clinton plant**
- Source: Energies Media | 20251227T190746 | Bullish | Relevance: 80%
- Constellation Energy is exploring the deployment of next-generation small modular reactors (SMRs) at its Clinton Clean Energy Complex in Illinois, driven by the increasing demand for energy for AI development. This initiative is supported by a new Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) with Meta, which provides a "lifeline" for the plant, ensuring its operation for the next decade and alleviating concerns about its potential closure. The move signals a broader revival of the U.S. nuclear energy sector, aiming to strengthen America's leadership in AI technology.

**2. Alphabet Stock Has Surged on AI Momentum. Is It Still a Buy?**
- Source: Morningstar Canada | 20251229T111227 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- Alphabet's stock has surged by 60.5% year-to-date, driven largely by its new Gemini 3 AI model and a favorable antitrust ruling. While the company is now seen as an AI leader, Morningstar analysts caution that risks remain, particularly concerning the resilience of Google Search and Cloud businesses, as well as the need for clearer evidence that AI investments are translating into measurable improvements. Despite these concerns, Alphabet maintains a wide economic moat and is considered fairly valued at USD 340 per share by Morningstar.

- Abner Herrman & Brock LLC has decreased its stake in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 1.5% in the third quarter, reducing its holdings to 415,839 shares valued at $77.6 million, though NVIDIA remains its largest position. This reduction comes as NVIDIA exceeded quarterly expectations with $1.30 EPS and $57.01 billion in revenue, leading analysts to maintain a "Buy" rating and raise price targets.

**4. 2 Billionaires Just Loaded Up on Microsoft Stock. Do They Know Something We Don't for 2026?**
- Source: Finviz | 20251229T220832 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- Microsoft's stock performance in 2025 has been modest, underperforming the S&P 500, yet billionaires like Peter Thiel and Daniel Loeb significantly increased their stakes in the company during Q3. This suggests a strong belief in Microsoft's potential for 2026, likely due to its substantial investment in OpenAI and the robust growth of its Azure cloud computing services in the AI sector. Despite its current high valuation, these investors may foresee significant returns from Microsoft's role as a key AI facilitator.

| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
