This transaction, combined with a previously announced sale of 49% to Erste Group Bank AG, will leave Banco Santander with approximately a 9.7% stake in the Polish bank.

Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
