### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 5 raises (avg +7%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.82 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (margin 33%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (4.4x), low leverage (D/E 0.23). Analyst sentiment positive (5 raises, avg +7%). Insider selling cluster ($15.5M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 3 selling).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
