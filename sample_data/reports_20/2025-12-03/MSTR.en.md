**1. MSTR Stock Today: MicroStrategy (Strategy Inc) Plunges as Bitcoin Slides, Even After $1.44B Cash Reserve – Price, News & Forecast (Dec 1, 2025)**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251201T042404 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Strategy Inc (formerly MicroStrategy) saw its stock (NASDAQ: MSTR) plunge by 11% on December 1, 2025, after Bitcoin slid and the company released a significantly lowered 2025 outlook. Despite the drop, Strategy Inc announced a new $1.44 billion USD reserve, funded by issuing common stock, to cover dividend and interest obligations without selling its substantial Bitcoin holdings. The company dramatically widened its 2025 financial outlook, projecting a net income between -$5.5 billion and +$6.3 billion, a stark contrast to earlier optimistic forecasts, highlighting the volatility tied to its Bitcoin-heavy treasury amid changing accounting standards.

3. Elevated short interest (10.9%): bears positioning against stock.
4. Long-term trend broken: trading 43.1% below SMA200.
5. Falling knife pattern: rapid decline without stabilization, catch risk elevated.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
