- Sea Limited, a major Southeast Asian tech company built on E-Commerce (Shopee), Digital Financial Services (Monee), and Digital Entertainment (Garena), has shown significant revenue growth and a return to profitability for the first nine months of 2025. While Shopee and Monee offer strong long-term potential, the company faces intense competition, margin pressures, and regulatory risks, with the sustainability of its gaming division, Garena, being a major uncertainty. Investors are left to weigh Sea's growth prospects against these challenges, making it a high-risk, high-reward stock.
