**1. Alliant Energy’s Renewable Buildout Is Steady, But Debt Is Doing The Talking**
- Source: Finimize | 20260102T230827 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Alliant Energy (LNT) is a regulated utility undertaking an $11.5 billion investment in renewables and grid upgrades, targeting 5%–7% annual EPS growth. While the company boasts predictable cash flows, a strong dividend track record, and aims for an 11% CAGR in its regulatory rate base through 2028, it faces challenges from high leverage (7.47x net debt/EBITDA) and a negative free-cash-flow yield. These factors make it sensitive to regulatory outcomes and interest rate changes, keeping investors focused on rate cases and cash flow trends despite a consensus "Buy" rating.
