- Source: Finviz | 20251224T230300 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- AMETEK (AME) has shown lackluster revenue growth and its core business is falling behind, with annualized revenue growth of 5.1% over the last two years being below its five-year trend. The company failed to grow organic revenue because it failed to grow its overall revenues in its core business segment.
