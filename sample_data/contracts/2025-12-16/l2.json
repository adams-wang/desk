  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: CONTRACTION (MEDIUM confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE positioning, which aligns with our mixed rotation showing 8 bullish sectors. The balanced 52% breadth supports our NEUTRAL rotation bias rather than extreme positioning.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll signals validated against v6.1 thresholds. IGNITION signals (XLU, XLRE) show positive MRS_5 in Zone D. TREND signals (XLP, XLB, XLC, XLI) show positive MRS_20 in Zone A. MOMENTUM signals (XLY, XLF) show strong MRS_20 in Zone F. No anomalies detected.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: D (3 sectors: XLU, XLRE, XLE), A (4 sectors: XLP, XLB, XLC, XLI), F (2 sectors: XLY, XLF), E (2 sectors: XLV, XLK). Rotation shows mixed offensive/defensive with no clear directional bias.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo L1 vs L2 conflict - NORMAL regime supports mixed sector performance. News context shows energy weakness, financial strength, and tech uncertainty aligning with technical signals. Defensive leadership (XLP) consistent with late-cycle positioning.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nCONTRACTION phase identified due to defensive sector leadership (Consumer Staples trending), Utilities showing ignition (typical late-cycle), and Energy weakness. The mixed offensive/defensive rotation with no clear cyclical leadership pattern supports late-cycle/early contraction positioning.\n\nKey Insight: The market is in a transitional phase where defensive sectors (Consumer Staples) are trending while traditional early-cycle sectors (Utilities, Real Estate) show ignition signals, suggesting investors are positioning for potential economic deceleration while maintaining exposure to momentum areas like Financials."
