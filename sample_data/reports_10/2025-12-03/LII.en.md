-  Lennox International Inc. (NYSE:LII) has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 20.4x, similar to the US market median of 19x, despite analysts forecasting weaker earnings growth of 2.9% for the coming year compared to the market's 16% prediction. While the company has shown decent historical earnings growth, its current P/E suggests investors are overlooking the subdued growth outlook. This situation could make it challenging for the stock to maintain its current price levels unless growth expectations improve.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
