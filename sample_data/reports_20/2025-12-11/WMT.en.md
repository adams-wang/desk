- This holiday season, Walmart is catering to two distinct consumer groups: lower-to-middle income shoppers focusing on necessities, and a growing segment of affluent customers drawn by store renovations and upscale products. While lower-income individuals face rising prices and stagnant wages, wealthier consumers drive increased spending due to stock market gains and higher income growth, leading to a "K-shaped" economic recovery. This shift sees even budget retailers like Dollar Tree and Dollar General attracting higher-earning individuals, raising concerns among some analysts about where lower-income consumers will find affordable options.
