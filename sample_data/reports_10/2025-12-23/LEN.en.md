- Source: HousingWire | 20251222T200845 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 63%
- KB Home is heavily focusing on a built-to-order (BTO) strategy to achieve higher margins, despite risks of reduced sales volume in a market currently dominated by spec homes.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251221T210933 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- KB Home (KBH) delivered mixed results, beating earnings and revenue expectations but offering a cautious 2026 outlook due to affordability pressures and a thinner backlog. This led to an 8.5% share price decline, raising questions about whether it's an undervalued opportunity or if the market is correctly pricing in slower growth.
