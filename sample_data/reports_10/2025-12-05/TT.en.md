- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251203T095354 | Neutral | Relevance: 59%
- Over the past year, Lennox International Inc. (NYSE:LII) insiders have sold a significant stake in the company, with one director selling US$15m worth of shares at a price well above the current market price. While this specific sale isn't strongly bearish, there have been additional insider sales, including the Chairman of the Board disposing of US$295k worth of shares recently, with no insider purchases recorded. Despite high insider ownership of 2.2% (US$379m), the consistent selling activity suggests caution for investors, though the company remains profitable and growing.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | IGNITION (Zone D) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with stabilizing volatility and moderate risk appetite. Fed in data-dependent mode with 7 days to FOMC—soft economic data (retail -4.67% MoM, CPI 2.89% rising) offsetting labor resilience. AI infrastructure demand and capital reallocation themes dominating corporate narratives, signaling selective risk-on in growth/tech segments. Narrow breadth (52% above 50MA) and neutral put/call suggest complacency but not excess—standard late-cycle positioning amid policy uncertainty.*
