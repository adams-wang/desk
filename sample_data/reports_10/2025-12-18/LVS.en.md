- Las Vegas Sands (LVS) recently saw its CEO sell $26.6 million in stock after exercising options, while Goldman Sachs upgraded the company to "Buy" with an $80 price target.

- Robert Goldstein, CEO of Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS), sold 734,511 shares of the company's stock for approximately $49.07 million. This insider transaction comes as LVS posted stronger-than-expected Q3 earnings and revenue, leading analysts to raise price targets and maintain "buy" ratings for the stock, which is trading near its 52-week high with a 1.5% dividend yield.

**3. Las Vegas Sands Rating, Price Target Lifted by Goldman Sachs**
- Source: Casino.org | 20251216T180238 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Goldman Sachs has upgraded Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) to “buy” from “hold,” increasing its price target to $80 from $64 due to strong performance at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and an anticipated $2 billion share buyback program. The analyst, Lizzie Dove, also maintains a “buy” rating on Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN), citing its high-end assets and improving Macau market conditions.

**4. Assessing DiamondRock Hospitality (DRH) Valuation After Recent 3‑Month Share Price Outperformance**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251216T210846 | Neutral | Relevance: 65%
- DiamondRock Hospitality (DRH) has seen its shares rise 15% in the past three months, outperforming many real estate peers, as investors reconsider hotel-focused REITs. Despite this recent outperformance, the company is still considered 2.8% undervalued with a fair value estimate of $9.59, driven by repositioning projects and anticipated RevPAR growth. However, persistent softness in resort RevPAR and urban expense pressures pose potential risks to this optimistic valuation.
