**1. ASH 2025: Arcellx and Gilead’s Anito-cel challenges CAR-T market in R/R MM**
- Source: Clinical Trials Arena | 20251209T120929 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- At ASH 2025, updated results from the Phase II iMMagine-1 clinical trial of Arcellx and Gilead's anito-cel for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM) were presented, showing strong efficacy with a 96% overall response rate and a manageable safety profile. Anito-cel is positioned as a strong competitor to existing CAR-T therapies like J&J/Legend's Carvykti, with sales projected to reach $658 million by 2032. The ongoing Phase III iMMagine-3 trial aims to expand its label into earlier treatment lines, potentially establishing it as a best-in-class option.

**2. What Arcellx (ACLX)'s Anito‑cel Phase 2 Data Means For Shareholders**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251211T150932 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 97%
-  Arcellx recently announced positive Phase 2 data for anito-cel in multiple myeloma, showcasing deep, durable responses and a manageable safety profile, with no delayed neurotoxicities reported. This therapy, partnered with Kite (a Gilead company), has Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and RMAT designations, positioning it as a potentially differentiated CAR T option for a planned 2026 commercial launch. Despite positive trial results, Arcellx remains loss-making with significant cash burn, and its stock trades at a rich price-to-book multiple, highlighting ongoing execution risks related to manufacturing, pricing, and real-world safety.
