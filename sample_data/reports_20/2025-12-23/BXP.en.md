- Castellum announced that extraordinary resolutions were adopted for its Norwegian kroner-denominated bonds maturing in 2026, 2028, and 2029, and its euro-denominated 2030 bond, leading to amendments in their terms taking effect on December 22. However, proposed changes for euro-denominated bonds maturing in 2026 and 2029 were not adopted due to insufficient resolution.
