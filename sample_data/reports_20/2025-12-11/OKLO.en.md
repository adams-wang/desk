-  Goldman Sachs has reiterated its Neutral rating and $106.00 price target on Oklo (NYSE:OKLO) following an investor meeting. Despite being currently overvalued according to InvestingPro data, Oklo aims to deploy 75MW Aurora Powerhouse reactors and is focused on developing 3-4 nuclear campuses in the U.S. The company has a strong financial position with more cash than debt and an impressive gross profit margin, although it is not yet profitable.

-  Oklo Inc. recently filed to raise up to US$1.50 billion through an at-the-market Class A common stock offering to fund its advanced nuclear reactor program. This move highlights the capital-intensive nature of Oklo's path, as it develops compact reactors for AI data centers and other long-term customers.

This move, which complements its existing cash reserves, aims to provide financial stability for the nuclear newcomer, despite potential dilution risks for investors. Other nuclear players like NuScale Power and NANO Nuclear Energy also heavily rely on equity issuance to finance their capital-intensive projects.
