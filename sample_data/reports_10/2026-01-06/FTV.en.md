- Mizuho downgraded Fortive (NYSE:FTV) from Outperform to Underperform, lowering its price target to $51.00 from $54.00, citing concerns about a slow start to 2026 across over half of Fortive’s portfolio. The investment firm reduced its 2026 earnings per share estimate to $2.71 and its 2027 EPS estimate to $3.00, both below consensus, and expects the stock to lag the sector due to near-term demand risks and the past "break-up catalyst." Despite acknowledging Fortive’s prudent M&A strategy, Mizuho believes legacy businesses need to show improved growth to re-engage investors.
