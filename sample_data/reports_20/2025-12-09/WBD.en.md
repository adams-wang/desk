**1. Paramount and Warner Bros.: Hostile Bid Is Probably Superior to Netflix’s, but Not Clearly**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251208T200926 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 97%
-  Paramount's hostile bid of $30 per share for Warner Bros. Discovery is seen as potentially superior to Netflix's $27.75 cash and stock offer, primarily due to the certainty of the cash component and lower anticipated international regulatory scrutiny. While both bids value Warner above its independent worth and could lead to a bidding war, the author believes a Paramount acquisition offers better benefits for its shareholders than a Netflix acquisition. Morningstar maintains a $77 fair value estimate for Netflix and a $20 fair value estimate for Paramount, with plans to raise Warner's fair value to $28 if an acquisition occurs by early 2027.

- Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) experienced an 11% stock price drop since the beginning of December following its plan to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. The proposed $72 billion to $83 billion deal faces significant headwinds, including a hostile competing bid from Paramount Skydance, an antitrust lawsuit, and concerns about increased debt, leading to several Wall Street downgrades. However, Needham maintains a "Buy" rating, and the overall analyst consensus remains "Moderate Buy" with a potential 35-40% upside, highlighting strong fundamentals but rising execution risk.

-  Netflix (NFLX) stock is under pressure due to a complex acquisition bid for Warner Bros. Discovery’s studios and streaming assets, valued at $72-83 billion, which now faces a hostile $108.4 billion counterbid from Paramount. Despite this uncertainty and recent analyst downgrades, Netflix's core streaming business remains strong, supported by high engagement and a rapidly growing ad-supported tier boasting over 190 million monthly active viewers. The market is currently weighing whether the Warner Bros. deal will be a transformative win or an expensive distraction, with Wall Street's consensus leaning cautiously bullish on NFLX.

-  Pivotal Research Group downgraded Netflix stock to a hold rating from buy, lowering its target price to $105 per share due to the company's $72 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's film studio and streaming services. Analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak cited approval risk, a lengthy closing timeframe, and potential bidding war as headwinds. He also noted that the deal suggests Netflix's concern over declining subscriber engagement and the impact of short-form entertainment, leading to reduced subscriber and revenue forecasts.
