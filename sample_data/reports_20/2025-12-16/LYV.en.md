- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251214T070841 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) is expanding its global presence by taking over operations of Thailand's Impact Arena, despite recent stock price volatility and ongoing regulatory scrutiny. The company's valuation presents a mixed picture: while a narrative analysis suggests it is undervalued with a fair value of $169.05, an earnings-based view indicates it is richly priced with a P/E ratio significantly higher than industry averages. The expansion into Asia and improved ticketing technologies are expected to support future earnings, though potential regulatory pressure remains a risk.

This claim comes as the DOJ fights Live Nation's attempt to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit seeking to break up the company before a scheduled March trial. The government alleges Live Nation leverages its control over ticketing and event promotion to stifle competition by threatening venues and acquiring rival promoters and amphitheatres.

Some artists have successfully pushed back against the current system, offering a glimmer of hope for fans.
