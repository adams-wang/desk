However, the stock saw a modest after-hours bounce of about 0.5% to $36.22, partly influenced by stronger-than-expected guidance from Micron Technology. Investors are now looking ahead to Thursday's market open, with key U.S. inflation data (CPI) and other economic releases expected to drive market sentiment, potentially overshadowing Intel-specific news.",

VIX has risen sharply to 17.62 (+11.7% over 5 days) from complacent levels, signaling increasing anxiety among market participants. The 56th percentile reading suggests fear is building but not yet extreme.\n\nKey conflict emerges between rising VIX and declining put/call ratio (0.827), indicating institutional hedging rather than retail panic. This suggests smart money is positioning defensively while retail remains relatively sanguine - a concerning divergence.\n\nMarket breadth at 52.6% barely above neutral indicates narrow participation and vulnerable leadership. The tech sector faces mounting pressure from AI infrastructure cost concerns, with Oracle's data center funding issues spreading anxiety to related names like Eaton. Prominent investors including Michael Burry and Jim Chanos actively shorting NVIDIA adds credibility to AI bubble concerns.\n\nEconomic fundamentals remain stable with Fed funds falling (3.88%), contained inflation (2.89% CPI), and steady unemployment (4.6%). The normal yield curve at 61bps provides some stability, but the disconnect between stable macro and rising equity volatility suggests sector-specific stress rather than systemic risk.\n\nRegional banking shows consolidation activity (CVB/Heritage deal) while individual names face mixed results. The divergence between sectors indicates selectivity rather than broad-based weakness, but tech's leadership role makes its weakness systemically important.\n\nNews risk adjustment of -10% reflects building AI bubble concerns not yet fully reflected in VIX levels. The combination of rising volatility, narrow breadth, and sector-specific stress in market leadership creates conditions for further deterioration.",
