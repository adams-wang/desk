- American Express has significantly increased its acceptance rate in the U.S., now claiming "virtual parity" with Visa and Mastercard, with 99% of U.S. merchants accepting AmEx. This boost is largely due to its OptBlue program, which allows smaller businesses to accept American Express through third-party processors offering competitive swipe fees. While U.S. acceptance has improved, AmEx is still working to close the international acceptance gap.
