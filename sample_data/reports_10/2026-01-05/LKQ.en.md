**1. Lacklustre Performance Is Driving LKQ Corporation's (NASDAQ:LKQ) Low P/E**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260103T133921 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- LKQ Corporation's current P/E ratio of 11x is lower than the market average in the United States, suggesting it might be a buy, but this low P/E is driven by the company's lacklustre earnings performance. The company has experienced an undesirable 35% drop in EPS over the past three years, and analysts forecast future EPS growth of 7.6%, which is significantly lower than the broader market's anticipated 16% growth. This expected underperformance explains why the stock trades at a lower P/E, with investors not anticipating sufficient improvement to warrant a higher valuation.
