**1. Verisign: short sellers were wrong**
- Source: Domain Name Wire | 20251231T170627 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Verisign (NASDAQ: VRSN) has stated that data indicates short sellers were incorrect about the impact of Google AdSense for Domains (AFD) program termination on .com registrations. Despite initial concerns raised by short sellers, Verisign calculated that only 2% of its domain base was parked for monetization, and recent data shows no significant change in .com domain deletions. While AFD's closure affects some new top-level domains and potentially registrar pricing, Verisign's assessment appears to be more accurate than the short sellers' predictions.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
