- Source: Benzinga | 20251217T140905 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- TransDigm Group Inc's short interest has increased by 8.7% since its last report, now standing at 1.29 million shares, representing 3.0% of its tradable shares.

- Texas Permanent School Fund Corp reduced its stake in Transdigm Group Incorporated by 45.3%, selling 3,267 shares to hold 3,942 shares valued at $5.99 million. This sale follows significant insider selling from Transdigm directors and overall insider disposals totaling $200.85 million in the last 90 days. Transdigm, an aerospace company, recently beat quarterly earnings estimates and maintains a "Moderate Buy" analyst rating with an average price target of $1,576.29.

**3. Insider Sell: Joel Reiss Sells 3,900 Shares of TransDigm Group I**
- Source: GuruFocus | 20251217T001537 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Joel Reiss, Co-Chief Operating Officer of TransDigm Group Inc (TDG), sold 3,900 shares of the company on December 15, 2025. This transaction decreases his holdings to 3,600 shares, bringing his total sales over the past year to 41,100 shares with no purchases. Despite this insider selling, the stock appears modestly undervalued with a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.9, trading at $1,290.52 against a GuruFocus Value of $1,431.25.

**4. Hexcel (HXL): Reassessing Valuation After Buyback Plan and Upgraded Analyst Price Target**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T030926 | Neutral | Relevance: 57%
- Hexcel (HXL) has seen a 17% year-to-date stock increase, largely driven by renewed aerospace demand. Analysts have raised price targets to $83, citing a new $600M buyback and expected $1B+ free cash flow over four years, yet the stock remains modestly undervalued at $72.31 compared to a narrative-driven fair value near $75.79. However, its high P/E ratio of 83.7x compared to the industry average of 37.5x suggests potential valuation risks if growth falters.

**5. Americold Realty Trust declares $0.23 per share Q4 dividend By Investing.com**
- Source: Investing.com Canada | 20251216T221014 | Neutral | Relevance: 53%
- Americold Realty Trust (NYSE:COLD) has declared a Q4 2025 dividend of $0.23 per share, maintaining the previous quarter's rate but marking a 5% year-over-year increase, aligning with its 4.55% annual dividend growth. This REIT, specializing in temperature-controlled logistics, offers an attractive 7.19% current yield for stockholders as of December 31, 2025. The announcement follows a Q3 2025 earnings report where EPS missed analyst forecasts, and a recent downgrade from Evercore ISI due to anticipated challenges in occupancy and rates.
