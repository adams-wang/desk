- CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) stock is being influenced by ARK Invest's recent share purchases and investor digestion of new zugo-cel pipeline data.

Analysts maintain a "Hold" consensus, but some see significant upside.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251225T230946 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has provided positive updates on its off-the-shelf CAR T therapy, zugo-cel, including strong early responses, clean safety signals, and a new collaboration with Eli Lilly. Despite a recent share price recovery, the stock appears undervalued according to Simply Wall St's DCF model, suggesting a potential discount of over 55% compared to its fair value estimate of $126.78. The company's price-to-book ratio is slightly higher than the US biotech industry average but significantly lower than its peer group, indicating that the market may still be discounting its growth prospects.

**5. Is CRISPR Therapeutics Stock Yesterday's News?**
- Source: Finviz | 20251224T100955 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- CRISPR Therapeutics, once a high-flying stock due to the approval of its gene-editing therapy Casgevy, has seen its stock decline significantly from its 2021 peak. Despite the breakthrough technology, Casgevy's revenue generation has been slow due to the complexity of its rollout and the profit-sharing agreement with partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals. This has led some to question the company's immediate investment potential, suggesting it might be considered "yesterday's news" by some investors.
