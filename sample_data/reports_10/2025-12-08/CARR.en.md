- Source: AD HOC NEWS | 20251208T060801 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
-  Analysts are expressing caution about Carrier Global's (CARR) near-term outlook following a subdued business update and revised guidance, which led two major financial institutions to lower their price targets. The company's fourth-quarter earnings are projected to decline due to weaker-than-anticipated sales in the U.S. Residential HVAC market. Despite previous positive quarterly results, share repurchases, and dividend increases, the stock performance has been disappointing, although the long-term analyst consensus remains positive.
