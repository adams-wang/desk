The company is uniquely positioned to benefit from a significant increase in electricity demand driven by AI, data centers, and electric vehicles, especially as the largest provider of nuclear power in the U.S. However, despite strong demand projections and clean energy tailwinds, the stock's valuation is significantly higher than that of the broader utility sector, suggesting it might be overvalued for most investors.
