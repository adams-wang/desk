**1. Is SLB Offering Long Term Value After Its Digital and Low Carbon Expansion?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251216T012717 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- SLB appears to be undervalued based on its digital and low-carbon technology expansion, as indicated by both Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Price-to-Earnings (PE) analyses. The DCF model suggests a 57.0% discount compared to its intrinsic value, while its current PE ratio of 15.9x is below its proprietary "Fair Ratio" of 20.3x, implying potential undervaluation. Investors are encouraged to explore different perspectives on SLB's future using "Narratives" on Simply Wall St's community page.

**2. Who Owns Halliburton? Top Shareholders and Recent Insider Trades**
- Source: TIKR.com | 20251213T190844 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- Halliburton's ownership is primarily anchored by large passive institutions, providing stability despite energy market fluctuations. While hedge funds show selective accumulation and some active managers reduce exposure, insider activities are modest and concentrated. This reflects a view of Halliburton as a cash-generative oilfield services leader, with investors demonstrating disciplined positioning rather than extreme sentiment.
