The fund recognizes AMT's critical role in telecom infrastructure and the long-term growth potential driven by 5G deployment and increasing mobile data consumption. However, the article also notes that AMT is not among the 30 most popular hedge fund stocks, and suggests that other AI stocks may offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
