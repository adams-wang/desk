- GE Aerospace has spun off from General Electric, focusing on jet engines and services. This transition, marked by strong revenue growth and free cash flow, is expected to support capital returns and investment in next-generation propulsion. However, investors need to consider the amplified impact of potential air travel slowdowns on the now more concentrated business.

**2. This CEO is trying to revive some of what made GE so special**

- GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini is working to restore key aspects of GE's original corporate culture, particularly its focus on leadership development and performance reviews, which he believes were stellar earlier in the company's history. This initiative comes as GE, once a massive conglomerate, has been split into three public companies, with GE HealthCare being one of them. Arduini aims to leverage the benefits of a focused, smaller company while retaining the valuable management practices from GE's past.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T132518 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- General Electric (GE) has shown strong recent returns, with its stock up 2.9% in the past week, 13.0% in the last month, and an 87.1% one-year return. Despite a narrative suggesting a modest 5.6% undervaluation based on future cash generation and profitability, the market pricing appears demanding, with GE trading at a P/E of 42x compared to an industry average of 39.3x. Investors should consider if GE's perceived quality and growth justify this premium valuation, especially given potential risks to commercial air travel and supply chain pressures.

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
