No anomalies detected. Six NEUTRAL signals in Zone E, four AVOID signals in Zone D, one TOXIC in Zone C. No crossover alerts as no V values crossed zero in recent days.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: Zone E (6 sectors) showing noise/consolidation, Zone D (4 sectors) in ignition/underperformance, Zone C (1 sector) toxic. Rotation direction is mixed with slight cyclical bias but no clear momentum.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo L1 vs L2 conflict - both suggest cautious risk-on positioning. News themes support cyclical resilience (AI, infrastructure) while confirming defensive struggles (rate sensitivity, regulatory pressure).\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nEARLY_EXPANSION phase identified based on cyclical sectors (Industrials, Technology) showing positive momentum while defensives underperform.
