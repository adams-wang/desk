- Despite Amazon.com Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN) underperformance in 2025, with its stock up only 6% compared to the S&P 500's 18% gain, over 200 U.S.-listed ETFs continue to hold the e-commerce giant.

Analysts anticipate a potential rebound for Amazon in 2026, driven by AWS growth, AI monetization, advertising revenue, and improved free cash flow, suggesting that ETFs are positioned to benefit from this future recovery.

- Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), continues to use a desk made from a cheap wooden door as a symbol of the company's commitment to frugality and customer-first spending.

**5. 2026 Big Tech Quantum Bets: IBM and Amazon's Edge Over Pure-Plays?**
- Source: Finviz | 20251229T210603 | Bullish | Relevance: 96%
- In 2025, pure-play quantum computing stocks like Rigetti Computing (RGTI) and D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) saw initial rallies but have since experienced cooling momentum and heightened volatility. In contrast, diversified technology leaders such as IBM and Amazon (AMZN) are better positioned for 2026, as their quantum initiatives are embedded within large, cash-generating businesses, providing a more stable investment profile. Wall Street analysts suggest that while pure-plays lack near-term commercial clarity, Big Tech's fundamental-driven returns may be more favorable for investors in the coming year.

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
