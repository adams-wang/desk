|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | RISK_ON (MEDIUM) | 1.10x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*RISK_ON regime with strong participation and low volatility. VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) with breadth at 63.5% signals healthy risk appetite. Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
