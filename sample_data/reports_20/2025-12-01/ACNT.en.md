### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 12.6% to 10.3% (-2.3% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Extended beyond STRENGTH zone (10.3% > 10.0%), caution on chasing. MRS_5 at 3.4% confirms short-term momentum alignment. AM_20 at 11.5% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 8.4pp, stock-specific strength. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI overbought at 75, risk of mean reversion. Volume at 59% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.
