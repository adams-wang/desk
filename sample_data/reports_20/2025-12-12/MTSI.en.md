- Source: MarketBeat | 20251210T070910 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- MACOM Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:MTSI) stock hit a new 52-week high of $190.64 after several analysts raised their price targets and ratings, with a consensus of "Moderate Buy." Despite beating earnings estimates with $0.94 EPS and $261.17M revenue, the company still reports a negative net margin and P/E ratio. Significant insider selling by a major shareholder contrasts with increased institutional ownership from firms like Vanguard and Wellington.
