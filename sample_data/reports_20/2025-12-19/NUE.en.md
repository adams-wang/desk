- Nucor Corp. forecasts a 35% decrease in fourth-quarter earnings for 2025 compared to the prior quarter, driven by seasonal factors and lower volumes in its steel mills and raw materials segments. Despite this, the company expresses optimism regarding backlogs that are considerably higher than the previous year, especially in construction market segments like energy, infrastructure, data centers, and manufacturing. Nucor anticipates a gradual improvement in business conditions due to monetary, tax, and trade policies.

Despite the anticipated short-term decline, primarily due to lower volumes and margin pressures in its steel segments and planned outages in raw materials, the company remains optimistic for 2026. Nucor cites significantly higher order backlogs, especially in construction-related markets, and continued commitment to shareholder returns, having bought back shares and paid dividends totaling $1.2 billion in 2025.

Looking to 2026, Nucor is encouraged by materially higher backlogs driven by momentum in construction market segments like energy, infrastructure, data centers, and manufacturing.
