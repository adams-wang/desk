  "full_analysis": "Current market conditions reflect a NORMAL regime with IMPROVING characteristics, driven by a combination of calming volatility and selective fundamental strength.\n\nThe VIX decline to 14.08 (52-week lows) represents a dramatic -14.7% drop over 5 days, signaling substantial fear reduction from recent elevated levels. This extreme calm, however, introduces complacency risk, particularly given we're at the absolute bottom of the annual range.\n\nMarket breadth at 57.7% shows moderate improvement (+2.1pp over 5 days) but remains below strong levels, indicating selective rather than broad-based participation. This aligns with the put/call ratio of 1.139, which suggests underlying hedging demand persists despite surface calm.\n\nThe yield environment remains supportive with a healthy 64bp 10Y-3M spread indicating normal growth expectations without recession concerns. The economic backdrop is stable with Fed funds trending lower (3.88%), inflation contained (2.74%), and unemployment in a healthy range (4.6%).\n\nNews themes are constructive, highlighting strong earnings momentum (Comfort Systems, HEICO, Dollar Tree), AI economic benefits becoming more visible (Bank of America CEO comments), and strategic corporate activity. However, these are company-specific rather than broad market catalysts.\n\nKey conflicts include the disconnect between extreme VIX lows and moderate breadth, suggesting the market is calm but not euphoric. The put/call ratio above 1.1 indicates smart money maintains defensive positioning despite surface tranquility.\n\nThe regime is IMPROVING as fear subsides and fundamentals support selective risk-taking, but remains NORMAL rather than RISK_ON due to narrow participation and persistent underlying caution. No forward-looking news risk adjustment is warranted as current themes align with the calm volatility environment.",
