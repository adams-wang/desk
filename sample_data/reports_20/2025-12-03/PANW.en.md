- This article provides an outlook on Palo Alto Networks (PANW) stock as of December 2, 2025, highlighting its position as a leading AI security company with a rich valuation. Despite strong financial performance and aggressive M&A activities in AI security, the stock faces challenges including a premium valuation, significant insider selling, and integration risks associated with major acquisitions like Chronosphere and CyberArk.

While the company has shown strong financial performance with 41% EPS growth over three years and a 125% shareholder return, some shareholders may still question the high CEO compensation, especially since non-salary benefits constitute 99% of it. The upcoming AGM on December 9th will allow shareholders to vote on executive remuneration.
