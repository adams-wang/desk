While this expansion reinforces Phillips 66's logistics focus, it does not significantly alter the near-term earnings risks associated with refining volatility and upcoming refinery closures. The overall investment narrative for Phillips 66 still heavily relies on improving cash generation and reliability from its midstream and refining assets.
