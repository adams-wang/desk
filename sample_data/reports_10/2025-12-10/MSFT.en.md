- Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) experienced a slight dip on December 10, 2025, closing down 2.7% and trading marginally lower after hours, primarily due to increased regulatory scrutiny on AI and concerns over monetizing its substantial AI investments.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
