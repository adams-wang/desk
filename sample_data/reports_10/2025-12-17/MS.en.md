- Morgan Stanley anticipates a 16-20% hike in 4G and 5G telecom tariffs in India between April and June 2026, a steeper and earlier increase than previously forecast. This will mark the fourth major price hike in eight years, with strong players like Airtel expected to further increase their revenue share, while Vodafone Idea's share is projected to shrink. The report suggests that telecom companies are strategically preparing customers for these higher prices by removing cheaper plans and bundling streaming services exclusively with premium tiers.
