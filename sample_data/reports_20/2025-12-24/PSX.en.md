**1. Kinder Morgan, Phillips 66 Launch New Open Season for Western Gateway**

- Kinder Morgan and Phillips 66 have concluded the initial open season for their proposed Western Gateway Pipeline, a refined products pipeline from Texas to Arizona, and plan to launch another open season next month. The project, targeting completion in 2029 with a 200,000 bpd capacity, received significant interest and shipper commitments, necessitating the new open season to offer remaining capacity and new destinations west of Colton, California. This collaborative effort will involve new pipeline construction and the reversal of existing lines to efficiently transport refined products from Mid-Continent refineries to markets in Arizona and Los Angeles.

**2. Phillips 66 (PSX) Is Down 8.8% After ESOP Share Offering And Western Gateway Update - What's Changed**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251224T011057 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Phillips 66 (PSX) has seen an 8.8% decline after filing a US$1.72 billion shelf registration for an ESOP-related share offering and providing an update on the Western Gateway Pipeline. The pipeline update, including strong shipper interest and a planned second open season, supports the company's midstream growth strategy. However, investors face a tension between these midstream growth catalysts and near-term risks from refining and renewable fuels profitability, as well as operational disruptions.

**3. Phillips 66 (PSX) breaks critical uptrend: Retracement setup or reversal signal?**
- Source: FXStreet | 20251223T210827 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Phillips 66 (PSX) recently broke below a critical uptrend line that had supported its stock price from June to early December. This breakdown typically signals a polarity shift, where former support transforms into new resistance, suggesting a potential short-selling opportunity if the stock rallies to the $134-136 zone. However, bulls might view a decisive reclaim of $136 as a false breakdown or "bear trap," potentially leading to renewed buying interest.

- Phillips 66 and Kinder Morgan have concluded the initial open season for their Western Gateway Pipeline, attracting strong shipper commitments for refined products transportation into the Southwest and California. Following this success, a second open season will launch in January 2026, offering expanded delivery options, including new destination points west of Colton, California. This project combines new construction and repurposed infrastructure, linking Midwest refineries to key western U.S. markets.

**5. Phillips 66 (PSX) Is Down 8.8% After ESOP Share Offering And Western Gateway Update - What's Changed**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251223T122635 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Phillips 66 (PSX) has seen an 8.8% decline after filing a US$1.72 billion shelf registration for an ESOP share offering and announcing strong shipper interest in the Western Gateway Pipeline. The pipeline's expansion into Western US markets is expected to strengthen Phillips 66’s refined products logistics, supporting fee-based Midstream cash flow growth to offset volatile refining margins. However, investors face near-term risks from weaker refining profitability and operational disruptions, despite long-term strategic growth in logistics.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
