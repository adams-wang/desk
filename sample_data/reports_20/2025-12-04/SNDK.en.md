**1. Sandisk Corporation (SNDK): A Bull Case Theory**
- Source: Finviz | 20251204T141300 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- This article summarizes a bullish thesis on Sandisk Corporation (SNDK), highlighting its transformation into a pure-play NAND flash memory company. With NAND flash prices rising and anticipated demand growth driven by AI workloads and hyperscaler adoption, SNDK is positioned for a potential memory super-cycle, operating with increased efficiency post-spin-off. The company's upcoming Q1 FY26 earnings are expected to validate strong revenue and EPS growth, making it an attractive investment despite some AI stocks offering higher upside in the current market.

- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251202T045138 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- Zacks Equity Research has named Sandisk as its Bull of the Day due to its strong performance and positive outlook after being spun off from Western Digital, driven by surging demand for NAND flash solutions. Conversely, Home Depot has been designated the Bear of the Day, facing challenges from slower housing activity and cautious consumers, leading to an earnings miss and lowered estimates. The article also touches on BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. as a potential "next NVIDIA" due to significant growth and strategic acquisition.
