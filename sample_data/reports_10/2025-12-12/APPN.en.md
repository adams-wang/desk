**1. Appian (APPN): Valuation Check After Healthcare AI Workflow Win at HL7 AI Challenge**
- Source: Sahm | 20251210T000830 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Appian (APPN) recently gained global recognition after its "Bring AI to Work(flow)" solution won the HL7 AI Challenge, leading to a 31.54% share price return over 90 days. Despite this momentum, the company's five-year total shareholder return remains negative, and its current stock price of $43.04 is slightly above the analyst narrative fair value of $41.60, suggesting it may be modestly overvalued. Investors are left to consider whether the market is beginning to price in future growth or if current valuations are stretched given lingering questions about profitability and competition.
