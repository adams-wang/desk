-  Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) recently updated investors on strong operational improvements, including 8% year-over-year SHOP NOI growth and better medical office leasing spreads. This has fueled significant share price gains, with a 114.98% year-to-date return and a 585.76% three-year total shareholder return.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
