### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.22) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 7.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (21.9%, 10.2 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 7.09 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (6.0x), low leverage (D/E 0.36). Revenue growth strong at 22% YoY. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 2 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 5.9% to 3.2% (-2.7% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 0.8pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 (-0.1%) diverging from MRS_20 - short-term weakness emerging. AM_20 at 3.6% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI neutral at 59. Volume at 56% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +SUN (Resistance test).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
