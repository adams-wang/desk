3. Premium valuation (P/E 51x, PEG 2.0x) vulnerable to multiple compression.
4. Elevated short interest (9.8%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +2.6% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -0.3% to 2.3% (+2.6% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 1.7pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 at 1.0% confirms short-term momentum alignment. AM_20 at 4.0% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 3.3pp, stock-specific strength. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI neutral at 54. Volume at 58% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
