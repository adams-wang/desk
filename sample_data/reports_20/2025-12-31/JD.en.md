The bank expects a 3% year-over-year revenue decline for JD Retail in Q4 2025 and has trimmed overall revenue and earnings estimates for 2025-2027 due to softer demand and margin dilution from a revenue mix shift, particularly from food delivery investments. Despite these adjustments, JD.com is considered undervalued by InvestingPro, currently trading at $29.40 with a strong cash position.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
