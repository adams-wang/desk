### Key Risks

3. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. High short interest (22.0%, 1.5 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
5. Near-term weakness: 18.8% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite persisting. Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
