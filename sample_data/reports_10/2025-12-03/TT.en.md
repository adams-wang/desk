- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251203T095354 | Neutral | Relevance: 56%
- Over the past year, Lennox International Inc. (NYSE:LII) insiders have sold a significant stake in the company, with one director selling US$15m worth of shares at a price well above the current market price. While this specific sale isn't strongly bearish, there have been additional insider sales, including the Chairman of the Board disposing of US$295k worth of shares recently, with no insider purchases recorded. Despite high insider ownership of 2.2% (US$379m), the consistent selling activity suggests caution for investors, though the company remains profitable and growing.

| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
