-  Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) has announced an increased dividend of $0.1425, leading to a 2.4% dividend yield. Despite an impressive dividend history and growth, the company's current unprofitability and high payout ratio of 120% of free cash flow raise concerns about the long-term sustainability of these payments. While EPS is forecast to expand, the dividend's future stability is questionable, making it potentially unsuitable as an income stock for long-term investors.
