**1. Lacklustre Performance Is Driving Ameriprise Financial, Inc.'s (NYSE:AMP) Low P/E**

- Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) currently has a low P/E ratio of 12.5x compared to the broader US market, where P/E ratios over 19x are common.

While recent earnings growth has been strong, the forecast weakness likely suppresses the stock's P/E.
