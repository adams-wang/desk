- Source: Benzinga | 20251217T200903 | Neutral | Relevance: 92%
- Oil prices are expected to end 2025 on a tough note due to increasing supplies and waning geopolitical impact on market rebalancing, with U.S. crude falling nearly 3% recently and a total decline of about 23% this year. Despite this, energy-focused ETFs like Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Bull and Bear 2X Shares (GUSH, DRIP) and single-stock ETFs focusing on companies like Exxon Mobil (XOMX, XOMZ) offer avenues for investors to engage with the energy sector and capitalize on volatility. The International Energy Agency warns of a significant surplus extending into 2026, driven by OPEC+ production and steady growth elsewhere, making these ETFs valuable tools for investors navigating the supply-heavy outlook.
