**1. 3 Beaten-Down Stocks That Could Rebound in 2026**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20251231T200730 | Bullish | Relevance: 89%
- This article identifies three high-quality, market-leading stocks—The Trade Desk (TTD), The Blackstone Group (BX), and Salesforce (CRM)—that have underperformed in the recent year due to various market dynamics. Despite their recent struggles, the companies maintain strong business models and competitive advantages, making their current, more reasonable valuations attractive for a potential rebound in 2026. The article suggests that their underperformance is largely due to sentiment shifts and valuation resets rather than fundamental business deterioration.

**2. Belite Bio stock swings to $170 and closes up nearly 7% as rally stays hot into year-end**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251230T111031 | Bearish | Relevance: 62%
- Belite Bio's U.S.-listed shares surged nearly 7% and swung between $151.50 and $169.75, closing at $165.29, driven by investor interest in its rare-disease eye drug. This rally comes after major December announcements, including positive late-stage trial results for its Stargardt disease treatment and a $350 million equity offering. The company plans to file for U.S. approval in early 2026 for its oral drug tinlarebant, which currently has no FDA-approved alternatives for the condition.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
