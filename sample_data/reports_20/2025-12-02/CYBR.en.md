### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -8.4% to -5.8% (+2.6% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 9.8pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (0.5%) - potential reversal signal. AM_20 at -4.2% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 5.2pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.11x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). MACD histogram bearish (-2.54), momentum weakening. Elevated volume (1.4x 20MA), institutional activity likely.
