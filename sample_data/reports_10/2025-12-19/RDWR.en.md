**1. Radware (RDWR): Evaluating an Expensive Cybersecurity Stock After Its Recent Quiet Share Price Climb**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251219T020926 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Radware's shares have recently seen a quiet climb, leading to a high price-to-earnings multiple of 62.2x, significantly above its peers and the broader US software industry. While current revenue is growing, historic profits have declined, and a discounted cash flow model suggests the stock is overvalued at $17.10 compared to its current price of $23.87. Investors appear to be pricing in future sustained profit expansion, but this leaves little room for error if revenue growth or margin expansion slows.

**2. Radware warns of AI ‘internet of machines’ by 2026**
- Source: SecurityBrief Australia | 20251218T020905 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Radware predicts that machine-to-machine traffic, AI-driven attacks, and stricter regulation will transform digital risk by 2026, leading to an "internet of machines." The company expects autonomous software agents, new compliance rules, and AI-enabled threats to redefine how organizations manage vulnerabilities and defend applications, with APIs becoming a primary focus for attackers. The report also highlights the emergence of AI-native supply chain incidents, the evolution of DDoS attacks into strategic blind spots orchestrated by AI, and the expansion of Zero Trust principles to machine identities and AI agents.
