This decision comes as investor pressure mounts due to challenges in its partnership with Kroger Co. in the U.S., which has seen the rollout of automated warehouses fall short of financial targets.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
