  "cycle_reasoning": "MID_EXPANSION classification reflects Technology's continued leadership typical of mid-cycle growth phases, but the broad-based weakness across cyclical sectors (Industrials, Materials, Energy all in Zone D) suggests potential transition risks. The concentration in a single leading sector rather than broad-based cyclical strength indicates a maturing expansion phase with selective quality focus rather than broad risk appetite.",
  "rotation_analysis": "Current rotation exhibits extreme concentration with Technology as the sole outperformer in a sea of underperformance. Seven sectors clustered in Zone D (Ignition) suggests potential for broad-based recovery, but negative momentum across most sectors indicates this recovery has not yet materialized. The stark divergence between XLK's +1.15% MRS_20 and the next best performer at +0.29% highlights unusual market leadership concentration. Utilities' toxic classification (-5.55% MRS_20) reflects severe interest rate sensitivity, while the absence of any defensive sector strength suggests this is not a typical late-cycle rotation but rather a quality-focused flight amid uncertainty.",
  "l1_alignment": "L1's AGGRESSIVE bias appears at odds with sector rotation showing only one bullish signal, but this aligns with the NORMAL regime's emphasis on selective positioning. Technology's strong performance supports aggressive allocation to quality growth while avoiding broad cyclical exposure. The 48.3% breadth reading from L1 context validates this concentrated approach rather than broad market participation.",
  "key_insight": "Market is experiencing an extreme concentration event with Technology as the sole outperformer while seven sectors cluster in potential ignition zones - this suggests either an imminent broad rotation or continued quality-focused leadership amid cyclical weakness.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: MID_EXPANSION (MEDIUM confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias aligns well with sector rotation showing Technology leadership. Single offensive bullish signal (XLK) matches moderate risk appetite in stable conditions.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll signals validate correctly - 1 TREND, 2 NEUTRAL, 7 AVOID, 1 TOXIC. No anomalies detected. Technology's Zone A position with positive MRS_5 supports TREND signal. Utilities' -5.55% MRS_20 justifies TOXIC classification.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nZone distribution shows concentration in D (Ignition) with 7 sectors, suggesting broad-based rotation pressure. Only XLK in Zone A (Trend), XLC/XLF in Zone E (Noise), XLU in Zone C (Toxic). Rotation direction is defensive with most sectors underperforming.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nL1 AGGRESSIVE bias conflicts with predominantly defensive sector positioning (8 bearish vs 1 bullish). Resolution: Technology's strong performance and low VIX (16.66) support selective risk-taking in quality growth while avoiding broad cyclical exposure. Goldman clients' caution post-November validates defensive positioning.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nMID_EXPANSION classification reflects Technology's continued leadership typical of mid-cycle growth phases, but the broad-based weakness across cyclical sectors (Industrials, Materials, Energy all in Zone D) suggests potential transition risks. The concentration in a single leading sector rather than broad-based cyclical strength indicates a maturing expansion phase with selective quality focus rather than broad risk appetite.\n\nKey Insight: Market is experiencing an extreme concentration event with Technology as the sole outperformer while seven sectors cluster in potential ignition zones - this suggests either an imminent broad rotation or continued quality-focused leadership amid cyclical weakness."
