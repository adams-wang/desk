- Commonwealth Equity Services LLC reduced its stake in Altria Group, Inc. by 10.3%, selling 163,882 shares, but still holds over 1.4 million shares valued at approximately $94.65 million.

**2. Where Will Altria Be in 5 Years?**
- Source: The Motley Fool | 20260105T174426 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Altria, the dominant U.S. cigarette company, has experienced a significant decline in cigarette volume and revenue over the last five years, despite its Marlboro brand's market share. While the company has used price hikes and stock buybacks to offset these trends and continue dividend increases, its business fundamentals are deteriorating. If current negative trends persist, Altria's future looks bleak, making its high dividend yield a risky proposition for conservative income investors.

- Altria Group's stock has shown a slow but steady rebound, attracting attention for its high dividend yield and moderate capital gains despite being a "tired tobacco stalwart." The article examines whether Altria is an "income darling" due to its generous dividend and strategic repositioning into reduced-risk products, or if it remains a "value trap" given the declining cigarette market and mixed analyst sentiment. Investors are urged to consider the balance between income today and uncertain growth tomorrow.

- Altria Group, Inc. is shifting its strategy towards a diversified smoke-free portfolio, including oral nicotine, e-vapor, and heated tobacco, as cigarette demand declines.

*RISK_ON regime with strong participation and low volatility. VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) with breadth at 63.5% signals healthy risk appetite. Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
