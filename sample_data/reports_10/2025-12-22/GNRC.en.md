- Source: Yahoo Finance UK | 20251220T080813 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Generac Holdings (GNRC) saw its stock drop by 13.6% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 2025 results, with revenue down 5% year-over-year and residential sales declining 13%. The company attributed this to a significantly weaker power outage environment and subsequently cut its full-year 2025 outlook for net sales and adjusted EBITDA margin. This performance highlights the continued sensitivity of Generac's core residential generator business to outage frequency, raising concerns about its strategy to diversify into cleaner energy and data center solutions.

- US stocks saw little change in the week ending December 19, despite significant economic releases. The November jobs report indicated labor market weakness, while the CPI suggested easing inflation, though the latter was largely dismissed by markets due to government shutdown distortions. With the holiday season approaching, market activity naturally slowed.
