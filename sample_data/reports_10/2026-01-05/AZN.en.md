While not a "meme rocket," its steady, large-cap performance and dividend-paying track record make it an attractive long-term hold for investors seeking stability and diversified growth rather than short-term speculative gains. The article emphasizes its strong business fundamentals, R&D spend, and global presence, positioning it as a strong contender against rivals like Pfizer for multi-year growth.
