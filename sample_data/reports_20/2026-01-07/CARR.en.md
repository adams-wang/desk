This development, along with ongoing testing of a 15-ton unit, solidifies Carrier's focus on energy-efficient solutions, despite the company's modest revenue growth and premium valuation.

- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement at CES that next-generation AI chips could drastically reduce data center cooling needs, possibly eliminating water chillers, caused a dip in HVAC stocks like Johnson Controls, Trane, and Carrier. This highlights the sensitivity of the "picks and shovels" trade to architectural shifts in AI infrastructure, favoring companies like Vertiv and nVent with more exposure to precision or liquid cooling. The market reaction indicates a new focus on efficiency in AI infrastructure, moving from rapid capacity buildout to more compute per watt and advanced cooling solutions.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
