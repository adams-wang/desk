- HoldCo Asset Management is urging Comerica (CMA) shareholders to vote against the proposed $10.9 billion all-stock merger with Fifth Third Bank, arguing that the transaction timeline is too rushed and that the merger is primarily motivated by CEO compensation rather than shareholder value. HoldCo believes a "no" vote could force Comerica and Fifth Third Bank to offer a substantially higher valuation for shareholders, potentially approaching $120 per share.

**5. What Falling Interest Rates Mean for KeyCorp's Net Interest Income**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251231T150747 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 74%
- KeyCorp's net interest income (NII) has seen volatility, with declines in 2023 and 2024 but an increase in the first nine months of 2025 due to lower deposit costs and asset repricing. With anticipated interest rate cuts in 2025, KeyCorp expects NII growth, supported by stabilizing funding costs and increased loan volumes, while its peers Fifth Third Bancorp and U.S. Bancorp also show positive NII trends. The company projects its 2025 NII to rise 22% year over year and its net interest margin (NIM) to exceed 3% by the end of 2026.
