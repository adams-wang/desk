- Source: South China Morning Post | 20251202T082200 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Morgan Stanley predicts the mainland China property market slump will extend into the first quarter of 2026 due to weak buyer sentiment and limited policy support. Sales at top 100 developers dropped significantly in November 2025 and over the first 11 months of the year, with little expectation for a turnaround despite calls for stronger government intervention. The US investment bank maintains a cautious outlook on the sector.

- Morgan Stanley will pay €101 million ($117.4 million) in fines to settle allegations of filing false tax returns and evading dividend withholding taxes in the Netherlands. An Amsterdam subsidiary of the bank reportedly acquired Dutch-listed shares for short periods to illegally offset dividend withholdings between 2007 and 2012. The bank stated it is "pleased" to resolve the historical matter, which comes ahead of criminal proceedings and in addition to previously paid taxes and interest.

- Morgan Stanley CIO and Chief US Equity Strategist, Michael Wilson, reiterates his 7,800 call for the S&P 500 by late next year, driven by a rolling recovery and strong earnings growth.

The bank reiterated its overweight ratings, projecting a 41% upside for Nvidia and a 10% increase for Broadcom's stock, both driven by strong AI exposure and demand for their products.
