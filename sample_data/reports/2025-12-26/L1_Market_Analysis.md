**Conflicts & Divergences**
- VIX at extreme lows (13.6) while put/call ratio remains neutral (0.888) - options market not confirming complacency

- Strong bank/tech news sentiment (+0.14 avg) conflicts with cautious 2026 outlooks in retail/industrials
- Yield curve positive but narrow spread (59bps) suggests limited growth runway despite equity optimism

**Positioning Guidance**
- Regime: NORMAL (STABLE)
- Confidence: MEDIUM
- Position size: 110% max
- Key action: Maintain current positions but tighten stops given extreme VIX complacency heading into January volatility catalysts

**Triggers**

- Downgrade: VIX spike above 20 on earnings/tariff concerns, Breadth falls below 45% signaling narrow leadership failure, Yield curve inverts on aggressive Fed pause signals

**Risk Factors**
- Extreme VIX complacency (1st percentile) vulnerable to January volatility reset
- Thin holiday liquidity amplifying price swings
- Tariff implementation uncertainty for Q1 2026
