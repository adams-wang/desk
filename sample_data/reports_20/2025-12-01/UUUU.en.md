4. Near-term weakness: 20.8% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -13.9% to -8.2% (+5.7% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 12.2pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -7.3% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 8.9pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.50x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 41. Volume at 40% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.
