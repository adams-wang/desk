- Zscaler has seen a 26.5% drop in its stock price over the last six months, trading at $229.31 post Q3 earnings. Despite this drawdown, the company's "zero trust" approach, surging billings of $671.4 million, remarkable projected revenue growth of 21.6%, and an impressive 29.9% free cash flow margin suggest a strong underlying business. These factors make a case for considering Zscaler as a potential buy despite recent share price volatility.
