- Sempra (SRE) has seen a recent 4% share price slip over the past month, contrasting with positive longer-term returns, which presents an intriguing valuation opportunity. While a narrative fair value suggests Sempra is 12.2% undervalued due to major LNG export projects, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model indicates it may be slightly overvalued at its current price of $88.49. Investors are prompted to consider both the upside potential from LNG growth and potential challenges from regulatory shifts and volatile global LNG demand.
