### Key Risks

1. High beta (4.27) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (16.0%, 1.3 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
4. Near-term weakness: 10.1% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_10 improving +6.3% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

Balance sheet: strong liquidity (5.5x), low leverage (D/E 0.48). Revenue growth strong at 135% YoY. Institutional flow bullish (7 buying vs 3 selling).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
