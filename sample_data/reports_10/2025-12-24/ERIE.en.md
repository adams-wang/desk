- Erie Indemnity's Board recently approved a 7.1% increase in its quarterly cash dividend, raising payouts to $1.4625 per Class A share and $219.375 per Class B share.

| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
