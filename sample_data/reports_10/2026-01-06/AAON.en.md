**1. How AAON’s Expanded US$600 Million Credit Facility Will Impact AAON (AAON) Investors**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T010928 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- AAON, Inc. recently expanded its revolving credit facility from US$500 million to US$600 million, providing additional capital for working needs, capital projects, and growth initiatives, especially in data center cooling and high-efficiency HVAC. This move supports long-term growth but does not alleviate near-term risks related to ERP execution and potential margin pressure. The company continues its quarterly dividend, balancing shareholder returns with strategic investments.

*RISK_ON regime with strong participation and low volatility. VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) with breadth at 63.5% signals healthy risk appetite. Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
