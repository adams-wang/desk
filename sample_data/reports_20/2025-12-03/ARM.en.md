**1. Arm Holdings: Long-Term Winner, Short-Term Consolidation Likely (NASDAQ:ARM)**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251203T230925 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Arm Holdings is rated Hold with a $150 price target, implying a 12% upside, but its premium valuation suggests likely short-term consolidation despite strong fundamentals. While recent FQ2 2026 results showed significant revenue and EPS growth, the stock declined as these robust results were already priced in. Investors should be patient as substantial multiple expansion is unlikely amidst current risks and valuation concerns.
