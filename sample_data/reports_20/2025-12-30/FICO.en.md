- Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) shares are nearing record highs, driven by strong performance in credit analytics and AI-driven growth. Investors are weighing this momentum against the stock's rich valuation and mixed macroeconomic signals for lending demand, as FICO's shift towards subscription-based software and decision management tools is paying off with expanded margins and predictable cash flow. Analysts largely maintain positive ratings, anticipating continued double-digit growth but noting the premium valuation poses a risk if consumer credit deteriorates or competition increases.
