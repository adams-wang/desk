- Source: Insurance Journal | 20251230T060747 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 72%
- Howden US has responded to a lawsuit filed by Brown & Brown, claiming that employees left Brown & Brown due to "mistreatment" and "terrible management" rather than a "pirate raid." Howden US asserts that the employees were unhappy with their former employer's corporate culture, compensation, and reporting, and denies allegations of trade secret theft or unfair competition. Howden US also highlights that Jim Hays, a former Brown & Brown executive now with Howden Group Holdings, is a plaintiff in the case despite being accused of complicity in the alleged poaching, and claims Hays' financial interest in Brown & Brown makes the allegations against him illogical.

- Howden US refutes allegations of trade-secret theft and unfair competition from Brown & Brown, claiming that mass employee departures were due to Brown & Brown's poor corporate culture, low compensation, and management issues. Howden argues that employees resigned voluntarily and were simply offered jobs, emphasizing that client movement follows brokers. The dispute highlights intense competition and recruitment practices within the insurance brokerage industry, amidst reports of Howden hiring over 200 Brown & Brown employees.

This adjustment follows Travelers' announcement that it will divest its Canadian operations to Intact Financial for approximately $400 million, a move expected to streamline its business and improve capital efficiency.
