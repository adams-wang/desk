This article argues that AI is the missing link, transforming CRM from a fragmented front-office tool into a unified, intelligent platform that connects data, workflows, and people across the enterprise. Companies like Bell Canada and Pure Storage are demonstrating how AI-powered platforms, such as ServiceNow's, can lead to significant improvements in customer service, efficiency, and proactive problem-solving by embedding intelligence natively and enabling agentic AI.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
