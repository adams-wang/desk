- Senior Trump White House officials reportedly met to discuss the antitrust implications of Netflix acquiring Warner Bros. Discovery’s film studio and HBO Max, expressing concerns that such a deal would concentrate excessive power and harm competition. The White House views a potential Netflix victory in the bidding war as a "red line" that would likely trigger a sweeping federal antitrust investigation, potentially blocking the deal and scrutinizing Netflix's overall market conduct.

- Netflix and Paramount Skydance have become front-runners in the bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, but their respective share prices fell over 5% following reports of all-cash offers.

**5. Exclusive | Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max would face stiff DOJ antitrust opposition: sources**
- Source: New York Post | 20251203T190913 | Neutral | Relevance: 95%
-  Netflix's potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and HBO Max streaming service is reportedly facing strong antitrust opposition from the Trump administration and the Justice Department. Officials are concerned that combining HBO Max's 100 million subscribers with Netflix's 300 million would create an entity double the size of its nearest competitor, Disney, and grant Netflix excessive pricing power over content and consumers. The DOJ likens the potential merger's anti-competitive impact to Ticketmaster controlling exclusive venues.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
