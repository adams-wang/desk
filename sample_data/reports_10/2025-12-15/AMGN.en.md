- Amgen recently received FDA approval for an expanded label for UPLIZNA, now including adults with generalized myasthenia gravis who are anti-AChR and anti-MuSK antibody positive. This approval strengthens Amgen's position in rare autoimmune diseases, offering a differentiated b-cell therapy with low-frequency dosing. While this expands Amgen's rare-disease reach, the company still faces challenges from biosimilar erosion and drug pricing pressures, though a recent dividend increase signals management's confidence in cash flow durability.
