### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.10) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 3.5x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Market regime shift could impact high-beta names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
