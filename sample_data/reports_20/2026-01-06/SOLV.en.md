- The global Perfluoroalkoxy Alkanes (PFA) Market, valued at US$ 430.4 million in 2022, is projected to reach US$ 626.3 million by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 4.8% during the forecast period from 2024 to 2031.

- A federal court has temporarily halted the implementation of a new 340B Drug Pricing Program rebate model, a ruling celebrated by hospitals. Hospitals claimed the proposed model, which would require them to purchase drugs at full price and then seek rebates, would cost them over $400 million and create significant administrative burdens. Despite an analysis suggesting minimal financial impact on hospitals, court officials agreed with hospital groups that the rule demonstrated an "anemic" administrative record.
