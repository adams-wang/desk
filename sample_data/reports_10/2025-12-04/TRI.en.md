**1. Thomson Reuters Bets On AI To Hit Its 2026 Goals**

- Thomson Reuters is leveraging AI to achieve its 2026 financial goals, with RBC Capital Markets projecting significant upside due to steady AI adoption, stronger pricing, and improved margins. The company's strategy involves integrating "agentic" AI into its core products, particularly within its Legal Professionals unit, to drive revenue growth and efficiency. This approach positions Thomson Reuters as an AI "helper" that can enhance customer value and justify premium pricing, distinguishing it from traditional information providers vulnerable to AI disruption.
