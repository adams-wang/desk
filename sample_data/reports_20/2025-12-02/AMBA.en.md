### Key Risks

1. High beta (1.98) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-22.0% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 5.0x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Near-term weakness: 15.7% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 3 raises (avg +9%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.96 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 115.0x stretched relative to 4% growth. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (2.7x), low leverage (D/E 0.27). Analyst sentiment positive (3 raises, avg +9%). Insider selling cluster ($2.2M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 4.0% to -18.0% (-22.0% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 22.0pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -16.5% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 17.5pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.06x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). MACD histogram bearish (-2.18), momentum weakening. Elevated volume (1.3x 20MA), institutional activity likely.

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
