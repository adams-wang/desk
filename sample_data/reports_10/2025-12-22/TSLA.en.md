- Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) closed Monday's session near record highs, driven by optimism around its autonomy narrative, particularly robotaxi developments, and the restoration of Elon Musk's 2018 pay package. The market is increasingly valuing Tesla as an autonomy and AI story rather than just an automaker, with significant attention on "unsupervised" robotaxi testing in Austin and the broader implications of rival Waymo's recent outage-related stumbles. Investors are now looking toward Q4 2025 delivery numbers, expected in early January, as the next critical "hard-number" catalyst amidst continued robotaxi headlines and holiday-week trading volatility.

- Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock is trading near record highs on December 22, 2025, driven by the Delaware Supreme Court's restoration of Elon Musk's 2018 compensation plan, now valued at $139 billion, and ongoing robotaxi developments. While analyst forecasts show a wide range with many targets below current prices, the market remains focused on Tesla's long-term autonomy potential despite near-term headwinds like regulatory scrutiny from the California DMV and softer EV demand in the U.S. and Europe. Investors are closely watching Q4 delivery numbers and further robotaxi progress as key determinants for future stock movement.

- The Delaware Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had voided Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 pay package, causing Tesla shares to rise. Morningstar maintains its $300 fair value estimate for Tesla, viewing the shares as overvalued but noting the reinstated pay package reduces key-person risk regarding Musk's departure. The compensation package, entirely share-based, is seen as crucial for retaining Musk and aligning with his desire for increased ownership.
