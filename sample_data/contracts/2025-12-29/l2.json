This aligns with our NEUTRAL rotation bias showing mixed signals across sectors.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nPre-calculated signals validated: IGNITION (1), TREND (4), NEUTRAL (5), WEAKENING (1). No anomalies detected vs thresholds.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: D (XLE igniting), A (4 sectors trending), E (5 sectors in noise), B (XLF weakening). Mixed rotation with no clear directional bias.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nL1 AGGRESSIVE bias vs L2 NEUTRAL resolved by recognizing selective opportunities in trending sectors while avoiding broad market exposure due to mixed signals.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nCONTRACTION phase identified due to mixed sector leadership with no clear cyclical pattern. Energy ignition typically occurs in late contraction, while defensive sectors (Healthcare, Communications) showing relative strength supports late-cycle positioning.
