1. High beta (4.24) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (22.0%, 1.5 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
4. Near-term weakness: 20.3% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
