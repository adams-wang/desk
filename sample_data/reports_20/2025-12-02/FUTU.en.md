*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
