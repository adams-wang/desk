- Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE: APD) experienced a nearly 25% stock decline in 2025, largely due to a strategic reset involving the exit from several capital-heavy clean energy projects, resulting in a $2.3 billion charge. This, combined with underlying business challenges like weak volume trends and macroeconomic pressures, and leadership changes, created significant investor uncertainty.
