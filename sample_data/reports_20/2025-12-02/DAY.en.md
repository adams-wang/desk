- Automatic Data Processing (ADP) reported a weekly shed of 13,500 private sector jobs, raising concerns about the labor market as the holiday season nears. While this introduces near-term uncertainty for employment-driven metrics, ADP's focus remains on cloud and AI products, and it has maintained shareholder confidence with its 51st consecutive annual dividend increase to US$6.80 per share. Investors should monitor potential sustained slowdowns in payroll growth, though ADP's long-term projections anticipate substantial revenue and earnings growth by 2028.
