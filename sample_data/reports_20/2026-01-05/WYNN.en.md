**3. Assessing Wynn Resorts (WYNN) Valuation After Recent Price Consolidation And Macau UAE Growth Narrative**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T160855 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Wynn Resorts (WYNN) has seen recent price consolidation, leading to questions about its valuation. The company is considered 14.5% undervalued with a narrative fair value of $143.33, driven by high-end customer resilience, Macau normalization, and UAE development.

**4. MGM Resorts extends branding partnership with MGM China**
- Source: Yogonet | 20260105T150426 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- MGM Resorts International has extended its branding agreement with MGM China Holdings Limited, effective January 1, 2026, increasing the monthly license fee from 1.75% to 3.5% of MGM China's adjusted consolidated net monthly revenues. This long-term agreement secures the MGM brand for MGM China through 2032 and potentially until 2045, safeguarding a key intangible asset. While beneficial for MGM Resorts and Pansy Ho, some analysts project a short-term negative impact on MGM China's EBITDA due to the doubled fees.
