-  Mosaic has announced a $4.1 million investment to develop Saskatchewan’s mining workforce, specifically targeting its Esterhazy potash operations. This funding aims to strengthen the talent pipeline by partnering with educational institutions like Sask Polytechnic, Suncrest College, and the Good Spirit School Division to expand training capacity, upgrade facilities, and create career opportunities for local and Indigenous students.

- Mosaic Fertilizer has informed a federal appeals court that a lawsuit challenging its use of phosphogypsum in a Polk County road project should be dismissed as moot. The company claims it completed the parts of the road involving the radioactive byproduct of phosphate production by November 4, 2025, thus rendering the Center for Biological Diversity's legal challenge irrelevant. Environmental groups have long opposed the use of phosphogypsum in road building due to potential cancer risks and concerns about radon emissions and groundwater pollution.
