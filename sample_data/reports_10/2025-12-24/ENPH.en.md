- Source: Utility Dive | 20251223T161251 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Enphase Chief Marketing Officer Marco Krapels anticipates a shift in the residential solar and energy storage market towards prepaid leases and third-party-owned (TPO) systems in 2026, driven by expiring federal tax credits for customer-owned systems.

This shift, along with installers diversifying into other home electrification technologies, is expected to help the market adjust to new financial realities despite projected contractions.

**4. The Resilient Giant: A Deep-Dive into First Solar (FSLR) Amidst the 2025 Renewable Shift**
- Source: FinancialContent | 20251224T103800 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 65%
- First Solar (FSLR) has emerged as a dominant outlier in the renewable energy sector, navigating recent industry turbulence with its unique "policy-insulated" business model. The company's focus on thin-film technology, vertically integrated domestic manufacturing, and utility-scale market has allowed it to post record earnings and solidify its position as a bellwether for the American energy transition. Despite potential risks like policy changes and global oversupply, First Solar's massive backlog, strong financial performance, and strategic role in powering the AI-driven data center boom provide a compelling long-term narrative for investors.

VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
