-  Figma's CFO, Praveer Melwani, sold 15,781 shares of Class A Common Stock for over $559,000 to cover tax withholding obligations related to restricted stock unit vesting. This transaction reduced his direct holdings in the company, though he retains indirect ownership through APM33, LLC. The sale follows Figma's strong Q3 fiscal 2025 earnings, which surpassed expectations and led to a raised price target from Goldman Sachs.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite persisting. Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
