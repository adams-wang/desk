### Key Risks

2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-4.6% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 7.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. High short interest (21.9%, 10.2 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
