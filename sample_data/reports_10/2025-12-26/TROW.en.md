**1. AI Boom: Bubble Signs, But Opportunities Remain**
- Source: T. Rowe Price | 20251228T010824 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- David Eiswert discusses the current state of the artificial intelligence (AI) sector, noting signs of a potential bubble due to rapid capital allocation and market frenzy. However, he emphasizes that the AI sector is still in undersupply, creating significant economic surplus and competitive advantages, especially for firms like T. Rowe Price. Eiswert concludes that while bubble characteristics are present, the pervasive undersupply and ongoing improvements mean major risks are still manageable, representing a continued opportunity for investors.

**2. AI: Potentially the biggest productivity enhancer since electricity?**
- Source: T. Rowe Price | 20251227T230828 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to drive the most significant productivity surge since the electrification era, surpassing even the internet's impact. Despite speculative risks, current AI valuations appear more rational compared to the dot-com era, largely due to strong earnings growth from major tech companies. Investors are advised to navigate this multiyear cycle by focusing on companies with "linchpin" technologies, strong fundamentals, and reasonable valuations, while leveraging asset class volatility.

**3. Amid stretched valuations, look to non-U.S. equities and local bonds**
- Source: T. Rowe Price | 20251227T200853 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Given stretched valuations in many asset classes, T. Rowe Price's Asset Allocation Committee recommends tactical opportunities in non-U.S. equities and local bonds. They favor stocks over bonds due to inflationary fiscal policies in the U.S. and predict that international and small-cap equities are best positioned for growth. In fixed income, the committee sees high-yield bonds as attractive and suggests taking currency risk through locally denominated international developed market and emerging market bonds due to the anticipated continued decline of the U.S. dollar.

**4. Amid stretched valuations, look to non-U.S. equities and local bonds**
- Source: T. Rowe Price | 20251227T200839 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- With valuations appearing stretched across most asset classes, particularly in the U.S., investors should consider non-U.S. equities and local bonds for tactical asset allocation opportunities. The article suggests favoring stocks over bonds due to inflationary pressures, and highlights international and small-cap equities as well-positioned for growth. Additionally, it recommends an overweight to unhedged local non-U.S. bonds to benefit from projected U.S. dollar weakness.

**5. Keefe Bruyette Reaffirms Market Perform on T. Rowe Price**
- Source: Insider Monkey | 20251226T231000 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Keefe Bruyette analyst Alex Bond reaffirmed a Market Perform rating on T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ: TROW) but lowered the price target to $115 from $117 on December 17, citing expectations of a supportive economic backdrop in 2026. T.
