## Sector Analysis

### Executive Summary
Cycle phase: CONTRACTION (MEDIUM confidence). Rotation bias: NEUTRAL. Key insight: Market is exhibiting a rare defensive-led recovery with Real Estate and Utilities igniting from oversold levels while Financials maintain momentum leadership - this mixed rotation pattern suggests investors are positioning for both Fed policy uncertainty and potential economic transition, creating opportunities in both defensive recovery plays and momentum cyclicals.

### Market Narrative
- Real Estate: Mixed individual stock performance, Iron Mountain underperformance concerns, VICI Properties dividend increases, secondary offerings.
- Utilities: M&A activity, energy infrastructure expansion, Halliburton analyst upgrades, lithium/cesium production agreements.
- Basic Materials: Corporate restructuring plans, aerospace financing, analyst target adjustments, cost-cutting initiatives.

### Rotation Summary
Current rotation shows unusual pattern with both defensive sectors (XLRE, XLU) leading from IGNITION zones while cyclical momentum sectors (XLF, XLY) maintain strong performance in Zone F. This mixed leadership reflects market uncertainty ahead of Fed decision, with investors hedging between defensive recovery plays and momentum cyclicals. The 4-sector TREND cluster (XLB, XLP, XLI, XLC) provides stability, while Technology's negative momentum stands out as the primary laggard. Rotation velocity is MODERATE with no crossover alerts, suggesting measured repositioning rather than aggressive sector swaps.
