- Source: TVTechnology | 20260105T160845 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 72%
- Several labor unions and public interest groups, including Free Press and NABET-CWA, have petitioned the FCC to deny the Nexstar-Tegna merger, arguing it violates station ownership caps and is not in the public interest. The proposed deal would create a massive broadcasting group with 265 stations across 44 states and Washington, D.C., leading to concerns about higher prices for consumers and adverse effects on local broadcasters. Opponents like EchoStar and Circle City Broadcasting claim the merger would result in a near-monopoly, reduce local news, and harm other local outlets.

- BCE Inc.'s stock is trading near its 52-week low despite a high dividend yield, with investors questioning capital gains and the sustainability of the payout amid rising rates and competitive pressures. The market views it as a defensive play, with ongoing cost-cutting and network investments balanced against softening media revenue and regulatory scrutiny. Wall Street analysts are divided, with many trimming price targets and suggesting the stock could be a value trap rather than a bargain.

- Gray Media has urged the FCC to prohibit the current way carriage rights of a “Big Four” affiliate are conducted with virtual MVPDs, such as YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV. Gray claims that TV networks are using bargaining tactics to retain sole authority over affiliates’ relationships with vMVPDs, interfering with local broadcasters' rights. The company argues that station owners, not networks, should control the distribution of their signals to vMVPDs.
