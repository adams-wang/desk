- MGM Resorts International has signed a long-term branding agreement with MGM China Holdings Limited, effective January 1, 2026, allowing MGM China to use the "MGM" name through 2032 with possible extensions. This deal stabilizes MGM China's brand rights and eliminates annual renegotiations, while increasing the monthly license fee from 1.75% to 3.5% of MGM China's adjusted consolidated net monthly revenue for MGM Resorts.

- MGM Resorts International has extended its branding agreement with MGM China through 2032, coinciding with MGM China's gaming concession term in Macau. The new terms significantly increase the monthly licensing fee paid by MGM China to MGM Resorts from 1.75% to 3.5% of its adjusted consolidated net revenue, which analysts believe will negatively impact MGM China's near-term EBITDA. This extension aims to secure MGM China's brand usage and reflects the increased market share MGM China has achieved in Macau's gaming industry.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
