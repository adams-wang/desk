- M&T Bank (MTB) has seen consistent net interest income (NII) growth, with falling interest rates expected to further boost NII by stabilizing funding costs and increasing lending activity. Management anticipates NII (tax-equivalent) to be between $7.05–$7.15 billion in 2025 and projects modest easing of rates in 2026, supporting continued NII expansion through balance sheet growth. Peers like Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) also expect NII growth driven by similar market conditions.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
