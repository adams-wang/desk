- Source: Investing.com Canada | 20251222T150940 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 75%
- Vici Properties Inc. (VICI) stock has hit a new 52-week low at $27.60, despite reporting strong Q3 2025 earnings which exceeded analyst expectations. The real estate investment trust faces headwinds, including downgrades from Evercore ISI and Wells Fargo due to concerns over its regional gaming lease with Caesars Entertainment and limited investment opportunities. While the company maintains an attractive P/E ratio, a strong dividend yield, and a "GREAT" Financial Health Score, its market performance has been challenging.

- CRH plc (NYSE: CRH) is set to join the S&P 500 on Monday, December 22, 2025, which is expected to drive short-term stock volatility and increased trading volumes due to index-tracking activities. The company also announced the acquisition of North American Aggregates and continues its share repurchase program and dividend payments, reinforcing its long-term growth and capital return strategy. Analysts maintain a generally bullish outlook, with price targets often in the low-to-mid $130s, though there's debate on how much of the S&P 500 inclusion is already priced into the stock during this holiday-shortened trading week.
