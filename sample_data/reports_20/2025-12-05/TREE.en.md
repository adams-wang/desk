- Fair Market Rents for one- and two-bedroom residential units have increased dramatically since 2021 across the U.S., significantly raising rental costs, according to a LendingTree study. On average, one-bedroom FMRs in the 50 largest metros are up 40.7% and two-bedrooms climbed 37.3% between fiscal-years 2021 and 2026. The increase reflects post-pandemic inflation, shifts in migration, and a persistent housing supply shortage, leading to increased financial strain for many renters whose wages have not kept pace.
