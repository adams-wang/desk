- Danaher (NYSE:DHR) stock showed resilience, rising 0.1% to $230.63, outperforming major U.S. indexes during a thin year-end trading session as investors anticipate the Federal Reserve’s December meeting minutes and Danaher’s Q4 2025 earnings call on January 28.

**3. Standard BioTools: Outlook Still Murky (NASDAQ:LAB)**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251228T140919 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- Standard BioTools is currently trading near its cash value following the sale of SomaScan, with Casdin Capital increasing its stake to 25%. While the company will receive $350M upfront and potential earnouts from Illumina for SomaScan, leading to $550M in cash post-transaction, its ongoing operations lack clear growth catalysts. This situation, combined with projected Adj. EBITDA breakeven in 2026 after divestiture and a 20% workforce reduction, indicates a murky outlook despite a recent rally in share price.
