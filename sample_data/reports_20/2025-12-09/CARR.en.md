**1. Analysts Express Caution on Carrier Global’s Near-Term Prospects**
- Source: AD HOC NEWS | 20251208T060801 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  Analysts are expressing caution about Carrier Global's (CARR) near-term outlook following a subdued business update and revised guidance, which led two major financial institutions to lower their price targets. The company's fourth-quarter earnings are projected to decline due to weaker-than-anticipated sales in the U.S. Residential HVAC market. Despite previous positive quarterly results, share repurchases, and dividend increases, the stock performance has been disappointing, although the long-term analyst consensus remains positive.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX remains in the mid-range, breadth is moderate, and yield curve is flat but not inverted—indicating standard late-cycle conditions. Upbeat earnings and positive tech momentum are offset by cautious guidance in consumer sectors, suggesting selective positioning is favored.*
