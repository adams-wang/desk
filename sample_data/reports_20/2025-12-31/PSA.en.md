- Public Storage shares are underperforming the broader market due to higher interest rates impacting REIT valuations, but strong occupancy and pricing power offer support. While the stock has seen a modest negative price return over the past year, its steady dividend and underlying operational resilience position it as a potential long-term recovery story for patient investors.

- Public Storage (PSA) shares have underperformed the broader market due to higher interest rates compressing REIT valuations, despite steady cash flows and potential M&A offering counterweight. The stock's performance is characterized by solid, unspectacular returns, appealing to income-focused investors looking for defensive plays rather than rapid growth. While analysts view Public Storage constructively with "Buy" or "Overweight" ratings, future prospects hinge on the pace of Federal Reserve rate cuts, consumer behavior, and effective growth investment execution.

- Atlanta led the U.S. in 2025 for new self-storage facility construction, adding 2.2 million square feet. This expansion significantly outpaced other markets, reflecting a nationwide slowdown in construction but continued strong demand in Atlanta due to population and economic growth. While overall U.S. self-storage construction declined by 12% in 2025, Atlanta and other growing markets like Phoenix bucked this trend.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
