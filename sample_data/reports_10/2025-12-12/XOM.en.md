The company projects significant earnings and cash flow growth by 2030, primarily from its upstream oil and gas operations like the Permian and Guyana.

- Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) is positioned for strong long-term returns due to its robust upstream operations in the Permian Basin and offshore Guyana, which generate the majority of its earnings. The company has achieved record production in both regions, and its low breakeven costs in these advantageous assets enable it to manage market fluctuations. While XOM's valuation is above its industry average, its strong operational outlook and significant acreage acquisition in the Midland sub-basin signal continued growth potential.
