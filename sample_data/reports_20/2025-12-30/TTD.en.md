- Belite Bio's U.S.-listed shares surged nearly 7% and swung between $151.50 and $169.75, closing at $165.29, driven by investor interest in its rare-disease eye drug. This rally comes after major December announcements, including positive late-stage trial results for its Stargardt disease treatment and a $350 million equity offering. The company plans to file for U.S. approval in early 2026 for its oral drug tinlarebant, which currently has no FDA-approved alternatives for the condition.
