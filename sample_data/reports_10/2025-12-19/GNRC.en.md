- Generac Holdings Inc (NYSE:GNRC) received an upgrade from Wells Fargo to "overweight" with a price target of $195, driven by potential AI data center growth. The upgrade comes after Generac experienced a five-day losing streak, seeing its stock fall by 13.1% this week and 10.6% year-to-date.

- JPMorgan has upgraded Generac Holdings (GNRC) from Equalweight to Overweight and increased its price target from $186 to $195. This upgrade comes as Generac shares saw a boost after a previous JPMorgan upgrade that set a price target of $200. The company recently released its Q3 2025 earnings, which saw adjusted earnings and revenue fall, leading to a cut in its full-year sales forecast due to weak residential demand for generators.

**3. Generac Holdings Stock: Is GNRC Underperforming the Industrial Sector?**
- Source: inkl | 20251218T120810 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Generac Holdings Inc. (GNRC) has significantly underperformed the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) over the past three months, year-to-date, and over the past 52 weeks. This underperformance is largely attributed to weaker-than-expected Q3 2025 results, driven by a decline in residential product sales and reduced profitability due to a less severe power outage environment. Despite these challenges and a lowered full-year outlook, analysts maintain a "Moderate Buy" rating with a substantial upside to the price target.

- Wells Fargo upgraded Generac Holdings (NYSE:GNRC) from Equal Weight to Overweight, setting a new price target of $195.00 due to accelerating growth in diesel generators for AI data centers. The stock, which has fallen almost 15% recently, is considered undervalued by InvestingPro despite a high P/E ratio, with Wells Fargo valuing its data center potential at $61 per share. JPMorgan also upgraded Generac's stock to Overweight, maintaining a $200 price target, despite recent Q3 2025 earnings falling short of expectations.

**5. This power generator stock has struggled recently. Wells Fargo thinks there’s a buying opportunity**
- Source: CNBC | 20251219T120854 | Bullish | Relevance: 94%
- Wells Fargo has upgraded Generac (GNRC) to overweight, citing increased power demand from artificial intelligence. Analyst Praneeth Satish believes the recent stock decline offers an attractive entry point, as the company is expected to benefit significantly from data center backup power needs. He estimates considerable sales opportunities with major hyperscalers like Amazon and Google.
