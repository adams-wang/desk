- The ERISA Industry Committee, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National Retail Federation filed a joint amicus brief supporting the dismissal of a 401(k) forfeiture complaint against Wells Fargo. They argue that the IRS consistently allows forfeitures to be used for plan expenses, reducing employer contributions, or additional participant allocations. The brief aligns with the Department of Labor's stance in similar cases, suggesting that ERISA does not impose fiduciary liability for practices allowed under tax codes and which don't diminish participant benefits.
