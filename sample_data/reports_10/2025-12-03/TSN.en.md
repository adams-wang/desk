While a popular valuation narrative suggests the stock is 7% undervalued with a fair value of $62.67, driven by expected earnings momentum, another perspective questions this due to a high P/E ratio of 43.4x compared to industry averages. Investors are advised to consider both the potential for growth from operational efficiencies and the risks posed by cattle supply shortages and high valuation multiples.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
