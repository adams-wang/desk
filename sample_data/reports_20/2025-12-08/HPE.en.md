-  Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) reported a trailing twelve-month (TTM) net loss of $59 million in FY 2025, despite increased revenue, challenging the narrative of a bullish margin-recovery. While revenue grew, profitability decreased, and volatile EPS figures raise questions about the stability of earnings despite anticipated gains from AI and cloud services.

-  Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) has announced an increased dividend of $0.1425, payable on January 16th, which translates to a 2.4% annual yield.

-  Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) reported strong Q4 FY 2025 results, demonstrating solid non-GAAP profitability and significant growth in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), largely driven by the Juniper acquisition and increasing AI server orders. The company's strategic shift towards a networking-centric portfolio and software-led GreenLake services is bolstering margins and providing resilience against rising commodity costs. HPE anticipates a back-half weighted AI revenue conversion for FY 2026, supported by pricing discipline and continued demand for its AI infrastructure.
