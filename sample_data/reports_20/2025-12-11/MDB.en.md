**1. After Earnings, Is MongoDB Stock a Buy, a Sell, or Fairly Valued?**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251209T090942 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  MongoDB reported a strong Q3 with 19% total revenue growth and 30% Atlas revenue expansion, leading Morningstar to raise its fair value estimate to $303 per share from $244. Despite the positive outlook and investor enthusiasm, Morningstar views the stock as moderately overvalued, trading at 2-stars, citing intense competition and uncertainty from new AI workloads. The firm maintains a "no-moat" rating due to limited adoption of document-oriented databases for mission-critical tasks and the sustainability of long-term growth.
