**1. Strategic Exit: Tower Corp Divests 91% of AST SpaceMobile Stake Ahead of Key Launch**
- Source: SatNews Publishers | 20251216T205821 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Tower Corp, also known as American Tower, has sold off approximately 91% of its stake in AST SpaceMobile, amounting to 2.28 million shares for $159 million, just before AST SpaceMobile's BlueBird 6 satellite constellation launch. This significant divestiture has caused AST SpaceMobile's stock to drop by 11.6% and raises questions about institutional confidence and capital stability in the Direct-to-Device (D2D) market, despite some insider buying. The market is now weighing the technical success of the upcoming launch against the loss of a major institutional investor.

**2. American Tower: Dish Not Forced to Sell Spectrum**
- Source: Broadband Breakfast | 20251216T000745 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- American Tower is petitioning a judge to prevent Dish Wireless from terminating its long-term tower lease, arguing that Dish's justification for exiting the contract is insufficient. Dish claims that the FCC forced its parent company, EchoStar, to sell spectrum, an event beyond its control that prevents it from meeting contractual obligations. American Tower contends that EchoStar's spectrum sales were a voluntary business decision and not a result of a binding FCC order.

As of December 2025, AMT demonstrates strong financial performance with raised 2025 outlooks, strategic pivots towards developed markets and data centers, and a commitment to dividend growth, while navigating challenges like high debt, emerging market volatility, and legal disputes.

American Tower contends that DISH's "frustration of purpose" claim is invalid as DISH's spectrum sales were voluntary business decisions rather than unforeseeable events. This case could set a significant precedent for the U.S. tower industry regarding the enforceability of long-term lease agreements.
