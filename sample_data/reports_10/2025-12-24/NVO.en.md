**1. Eli Lilly investors shouldn’t sweat rival Novo Nordisk having the first obesity pill on sale**
- Source: CNBC | 20251223T120929 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Despite Novo Nordisk being the first to receive FDA approval for an oral GLP-1 weight-loss pill, an analyst suggests Eli Lilly investors shouldn't be concerned. Eli Lilly is expected to launch its own oral drug, orforglipron, soon which has advantages over Novo Nordisk's offering, such as no food and water restrictions. Furthermore, Eli Lilly's injectable Zepbound has already surpassed Novo Nordisk's Wegovy in revenue, demonstrating its strong position in the market.

**2. Should You Forget Novo Nordisk and Buy This Magnificent High-Yield Drug Stock Instead?**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251222T090858 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- While Novo Nordisk initially led the GLP-1 weight loss market, Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro are now outperforming it significantly. The article suggests that Pfizer, despite past setbacks and patent expirations, could be a better contrarian investment due to its aggressive re-entry into the GLP-1 space through acquisitions and partnerships, and its lower valuation metrics compared to Novo Nordisk. However, investors should note Pfizer's high dividend payout ratio, indicating it's more of a turnaround play than a reliable dividend stock.

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
