- Oracle's shares have fallen 41% since mid-September 2025 due to investor concerns about the company's outlook and broader skepticism surrounding OpenAI's growth prospects. Despite this, UBS maintains a Buy rating on Oracle, predicting a potential revenue acceleration and a rebound in the AI narrative in the first half of 2026. The bank identifies several catalysts that could restore confidence in OpenAI and related tech stocks, including planned capital raises, improved ChatGPT usage, the anticipated release of GPT-6, increased enterprise adoption, and partnerships like Oracle's with xAI.

The firm views Oracle as a top pick despite concerns about its AI-related debt and ambitious expansion plans, citing strong revenue growth and a compelling risk/reward profile. Successful execution of its data center buildout to meet AI demand is expected to position Oracle as a key enabler in the hybrid and multi-cloud environment.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T000839 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Oracle (ORCL) is being re-evaluated due to its aggressive AI and cloud expansion, showcasing both the potential of its OpenAI-linked strategy and concerns regarding increased spending and debt. While a bullish narrative suggests a fair value of $389.81 for Oracle based on hypergrowth assumptions, a Discounted Cash Flow model indicates a lower fair value of $166.31, implying the stock is currently overvalued. Investors are encouraged to consider these differing views and potential risks, such as capacity bottlenecks or a pullback in AI spending.
