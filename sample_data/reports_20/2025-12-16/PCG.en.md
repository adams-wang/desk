- PG&E, responsible for over 1,500 fires between 2009 and 2019 including the devastating 2018 Camp Fire, has been under intense scrutiny and faced immense financial liabilities. Following legislative intervention, bankruptcy, and devastating setbacks like the 2021 Dixie Fire, PG&E has implemented significant wildfire mitigation efforts, including undergrounding power lines and vegetation clearing, leading to measurable reductions in ignitions and impacted acreage.

- Governor Gavin Newsom reversed course and extended the operating life of Diablo Canyon, California's last nuclear power plant, until 2030, despite earlier plans for its closure. This decision, backed by a well-funded campaign and nearly $1.4 billion in state funds, was justified by Newsom as necessary to prevent blackouts, though critics argue some state energy forecasts projected adequate supplies without the plant. The move signifies a broader resurgence of interest in nuclear power, with PG&E now exploring the possibility of keeping Diablo Canyon running until 2045.
