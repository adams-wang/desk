- Kroger is shifting its grocery delivery strategy, moving away from robot-powered warehouses to embrace artificial intelligence and partnerships with Instacart, DoorDash, and Uber Eats. This change aims to save $400 million annually and speed up delivery, but raises concerns among some customers and privacy experts about data usage and the potential for "surveillance pricing." Critics question whether AI tools will truly prioritize customer interests over commercial ones, and whether Kroger's reliance on third-party platforms for a core competency is a wise move for customer interaction and data privacy.

-  Kroger reported a $1.3 billion operating loss in its third quarter, largely due to the closure of three ecommerce facilities. The company noted challenges with middle-income shoppers, impacts from the SNAP shutdown, and a shift towards store-based fulfillment for ecommerce. Despite these hurdles, third-party delivery, private label brands, and retail media are emerging as bright spots for the grocery giant.

-  Kroger is scaling back its fulfillment automation partnership with Ocado, leading to a one-off payment of $350 million to the U.K.-based online grocer. This decision follows a review where Kroger identified opportunities to optimize its fulfillment network by closing some Customer Fulfillment Centers (CFCs) and not proceeding with others, while still planning to operate remaining facilities and open a new CFC in Phoenix with Ocado's technology. E-commerce remains a core part of Kroger's strategy, and the company is also expanding partnerships with delivery providers like Instacart, DoorDash, and Uber Eats.
