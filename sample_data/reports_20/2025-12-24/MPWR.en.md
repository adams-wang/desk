- Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Growth Fund released its Q3 2025 portfolio review, detailing key investment decisions. The fund initiated a position in Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) due to anticipated growth in energy-efficient electronics and AI demand, while also maintaining conviction in Ross Stores (ROST) for its strong performance and market positioning.

**3. Arista’s Secure AI Data Center Push With Fortinet Could Be A Game Changer For Arista Networks (ANET)**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251223T103852 | Neutral | Relevance: 62%
- Arista Networks is expanding its market reach beyond core data centers into AI-centric security, campus, and industrial edge use cases through collaborations like the Secure AI Data Center solution with Fortinet and new AI-driven campus networking features. While these moves are strategically important for diversification, the company still faces the risk of concentrated exposure to a few hyperscale and AI customers. Arista's projected revenue and earnings growth suggest a significant upside to its current price, but analyst views on customer concentration vary widely.

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
