**1. Reassessing J. M. Smucker (SJM) Valuation After Upbeat Brand, Coffee Margin, and Earnings Outlook Updates**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251220T025718 | Neutral | Relevance: 60%
- J. M. Smucker (SJM) has received a sentiment boost due to positive updates on its Sweet Baked Snacks and Hostess brands, improved coffee margins, and stronger long-term earnings estimates driven by Uncrustables growth. Despite these positive developments, the stock remains under pressure, trading at $98.69 against a narrative fair value near $116, suggesting it may be undervalued. The company's future PE of 17.2x on 2028 earnings is lower than the US Food industry average of 19.5x, hinting at potential for a valuation reset.
