- Cooper Companies (COO) is set to release its Q4 fiscal 2025 earnings on December 14, with expectations of increased revenues and earnings per share driven by strong performance in its CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI) segments. The CVI segment is anticipated to benefit from MyDAY lens demand despite Clariti weakness, while the CSI segment may experience softness due to conservative cash management by fertility clinics and declining PARAGARD sales. The Zacks Model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for COO, given its -1.05% Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).
