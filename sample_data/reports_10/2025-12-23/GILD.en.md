**1. Gilead Sciences (GILD) Stock News Today: New Herpes Deal, TrumpRx Pricing Pact, and Fresh Wall Street Forecasts (Dec. 22, 2025)**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251222T194542 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Gilead Sciences (GILD) is experiencing a dynamic period marked by a new herpes treatment licensing deal, participation in a Trump administration drug-pricing agreement, and ongoing strength in its HIV franchise. The licensing of Assembly Biosciences' HSV programs expands Gilead's antiviral pipeline, while the TrumpRx pact offers tariff relief in exchange for drug price discounts and direct-to-consumer access. Analysts largely maintain a "Moderate Buy" to "Buy" rating for GILD, with price targets ranging from $105 to $153, driven by HIV franchise durability and new growth opportunities.

**2. Gilead pays $35M to license pair of HSV assets from Assembly Bio pact**

- Gilead Sciences has exercised an option to license two recurrent genital herpes treatments, ABI-1179 and ABI-5366, from Assembly Biosciences for an upfront payment of $35 million. This agreement stems from a 2023 pact where Gilead invested $100 million in Assembly, securing opt-in rights to its pipeline. Both therapies, currently in Phase 1b trials, are helicase-primase inhibitors and have shown promising antiviral activity.

- Gilead Sciences announced it has exercised its option to exclusively license Assembly Biosciences’ helicase-primase inhibitor programs, ABI-1179 and ABI-5366, for recurrent genital herpes. This decision reinforces their collaboration to develop novel antiviral therapies, particularly as no new treatments for HSV have been approved in over 25 years. Assembly Bio will receive a $35 million payment and is eligible for up to $330 million in regulatory and commercial milestones, plus tiered royalties.

**4. Gilead Sciences (GILD) Stock: What to Know Before the Market Opens on December 22, 2025**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251222T043353 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Gilead Sciences (GILD) is in focus ahead of the market open due to a new U.S. drug-pricing agreement and positive late-stage HIV pipeline results. The drug-pricing agreement, including participation in TrumpRx, presents both potential policy risk and reduced uncertainty with tariff relief, which Gilead expects to be financially manageable. Additionally, positive Phase 3 results for its investigational HIV regimen BIC/LEN and the increasing commercial success of lenacapavir (Yeztugo) strengthen Gilead's core HIV franchise, while its oncology pipeline shows a mixed but significant outlook.
