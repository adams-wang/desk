### Catalysts

- AI/machine learning initiatives could drive multiple expansion if executed.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -8.2% to -12.3% (-4.1% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 16.3pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
