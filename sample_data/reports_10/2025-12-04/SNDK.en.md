- This article summarizes a bullish thesis on Sandisk Corporation (SNDK), highlighting its transformation into a pure-play NAND flash memory company. With NAND flash prices rising and anticipated demand growth driven by AI workloads and hyperscaler adoption, SNDK is positioned for a potential memory super-cycle, operating with increased efficiency post-spin-off. The company's upcoming Q1 FY26 earnings are expected to validate strong revenue and EPS growth, making it an attractive investment despite some AI stocks offering higher upside in the current market.
