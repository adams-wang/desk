**5. Exclusive | Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max would face stiff DOJ antitrust opposition: sources**
- Source: New York Post | 20251203T190913 | Neutral | Relevance: 71%
- Netflix's potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and HBO Max streaming service is reportedly facing strong antitrust opposition from the Trump administration and the Justice Department. Officials are concerned that combining HBO Max's 100 million subscribers with Netflix's 300 million would create an entity double the size of its nearest competitor, Disney, and grant Netflix excessive pricing power over content and consumers. The DOJ likens the potential merger's anti-competitive impact to Ticketmaster controlling exclusive venues.
