- FedEx is experiencing significant challenges in rebooking pilots' hotel rooms and transportation due to the mandatory grounding of its MD-11 freighter fleet during the peak shipping season. This situation, caused by an unprecedented number of flight changes and increased workload for travel managers, has left many pilots frustrated and without confirmed accommodations upon arrival.

- Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern claim their proposed US$72 billion merger will significantly reduce truck traffic, taking nearly two million truckloads off US roads annually by creating a continuous coast-to-coast railroad. They are pitching the deal to regulators as a way to enhance competition with long-haul trucking, reduce pollution, and lessen the burden on taxpayer-funded roads.
