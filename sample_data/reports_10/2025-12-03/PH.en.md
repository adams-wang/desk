*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
