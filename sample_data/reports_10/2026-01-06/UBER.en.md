**1. Lucid, Uber and Nuro unveil jointly developed ‘global robotaxi’ at CES**
- Source: WardsAuto | 20260106T174140 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Electric automaker Lucid Group, autonomous driving technology developer Nuro, and Uber Technologies have unveiled a production-intent robotaxi at CES. This robotaxi, based on the Lucid Gravity SUV and featuring Nuro’s autonomous driving technology, is designed for Uber's ride-hailing network. The companies plan to deploy up to 20,000 of these EVs in the San Francisco Bay Area and other global markets over the next six years, with on-road testing already underway.

**2. TomTom and Uber strengthen ties to enhance on-demand travel experiences globally**
- Source: GlobeNewswire | 20260106T013000 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- TomTom and Uber have renewed their partnership to integrate TomTom's maps, Maps APIs, and live services across Uber's global platform. This collaboration aims to improve Uber's routing, fare calculations, and pick-up/drop-off accuracy, especially in complex environments, by leveraging TomTom's continuously updated mapping platform. The partnership creates a feedback loop where real-world data from Uber trips helps refine TomTom's maps, thereby enhancing the user experience for both companies' customers.

**3. Uber stock slides as CES robotaxi debut collides with fresh Wall Street downgrade**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260106T004826 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Uber's stock slid 2.56% to $80.74 following the unveiling of a "production-intent" robotaxi at CES and a downgrade to Sell from Melius Research. The decline reflects investor concerns over intensifying driverless-car competition and Uber's long-term economics as a "demand aggregator" in the robotaxi space. The company faces scrutiny over how much of each fare it can retain when autonomous technology owners gain leverage.

**4. Uber stock slips on Melius “Sell” call as robotaxi competition looms in 2026**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260105T152700 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Uber shares experienced a 1.9% decline after Melius Research downgraded the stock to "Sell" with a $73 price target, citing increasing autonomous vehicle (AV) competition expected in 2026 and beyond. Melius warned that intensified AV competition could negatively impact Uber's returns and pricing power, even with the company's strategic partnerships. Investors are now awaiting Uber's February 4th earnings report for updates on its margins and autonomy strategy amid these competitive concerns.

**5. Uber stock set for Monday spotlight after UK ‘taxi tax’ workaround report**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260104T211537 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Uber is expected to be in the spotlight on Monday following a report that it restructured UK driver contracts outside London to reduce exposure to a new 20% VAT on minicab fares. This move, which shifts Uber's role to an agent rather than a transport service supplier in those areas, could significantly cut its VAT liability and prevent a 20% fare increase. Investors are now watching upcoming US economic data and Uber's next earnings report expected in early February, as the stock has shown sensitivity to headline risks and macro backdrops.

Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
