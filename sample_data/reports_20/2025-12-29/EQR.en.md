### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from 1.1% to 2.3% (+1.2% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 1.7pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 at 1.1% confirms short-term momentum alignment. Below SMA200 (0.97x), long-term trend not supportive. Volume at 50% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +DLL (Support).

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
