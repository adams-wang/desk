- PayPal Holdings, Inc.'s recent bank charter application contradicts the prior asset-light argument, but the author remains bullish. Securing an ILC charter could yield funding cost arbitrage on SMB loans, potentially boosting operating margins despite balance sheet concerns. While new regulatory capital requirements will impact share buybacks and short-term ROE, the author believes this transition ultimately reinforces a Buy rating at 11.3x forward earnings.
