### Catalysts

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.96 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 112.9x stretched relative to 4% growth. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (2.7x), low leverage (D/E 0.27). Insider selling cluster ($2.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 stable at -4.6% (minimal 5-day change). Below STRENGTH zone by 8.6pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -4.5% indicates price below own 20MA trend.

OFD pattern: -F0L (Decline).
