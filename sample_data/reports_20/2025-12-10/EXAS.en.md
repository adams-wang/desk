MRS_5 (-0.2%) diverging from MRS_20 - short-term weakness emerging. AM_20 at 9.9% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 10.9pp, stock-specific strength.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
