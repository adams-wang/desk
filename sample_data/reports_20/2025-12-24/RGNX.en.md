**1. REGENXBIO Inc. (NASDAQ:RGNX) Surges 27% Yet Its Low P/S Is No Reason For Excitement**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251223T110845 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- REGENXBIO Inc. (NASDAQ:RGNX) has seen its shares surge 27% in the last month, contributing to a 103% annual gain. Despite its current low price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.7x, which is significantly lower than the industry average, the company's past revenue performance has been lackluster. Analysts forecast future revenue growth of 41% per year, but this is still considerably below the industry's projected 120% annual expansion, justifying the low P/S ratio.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
