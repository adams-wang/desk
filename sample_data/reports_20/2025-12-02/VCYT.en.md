### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 21.6% to 5.7% (-15.9% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Currently in lower STRENGTH zone (4.0-10.0%), cross-sectional ranking at 92nd percentile. MRS_5 (-3.3%) diverging from MRS_20 - short-term weakness emerging. AM_20 at 7.5% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 6.0pp, stock-specific strength. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). Volume at 50% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
