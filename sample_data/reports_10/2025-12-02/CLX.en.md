**2. Clorox: A Dividend Champion Facing Headwinds, But Still A Buy (NYSE:CLX)**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251202T093900 | Bullish | Relevance: 99%
- Clorox is positioned as a market leader with a 48-year dividend growth streak and a nearly 5% yield. Despite recent setbacks like revenue declines due to an ERP transition, cyberattack, and inflation, the company's IGNITE plan aims for 3-5% sales growth and improved margins. With acceptable dividend safety metrics and an undervaluation at ~$108/share compared to a fair value of $119.80, Clorox is recommended as a buy for dividend growth portfolios.
