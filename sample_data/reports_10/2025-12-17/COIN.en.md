- Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) stock is holding firm around $252 after the company officially reincorporated from Delaware to Texas on December 15, 2025. This legal and governance shift does not affect Coinbase's business operations, management, or assets, and its Class A shares continue to trade on Nasdaq under the "COIN" ticker.

- Solana ETFs have attracted $608.9 million in inflows, with Bitwise Solana ETF recording 33 consecutive days of net inflows, signaling strong institutional interest despite lower overall flows compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, alongside this institutional demand, Solana has seen an 87% decline in active traders since January, raising caution about network participation trends.

The company's total holdings, including minor bitcoin and Worldcoin stakes, stand at $13.2 billion.
