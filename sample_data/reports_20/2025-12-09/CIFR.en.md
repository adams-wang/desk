2. Heavy insider selling: $155M sold (30 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 9.9x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. High short interest (21.4%, 1.2 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +7.6% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

Analyst sentiment positive (1 raises, avg +50%). Insider selling cluster ($154.6M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX remains in the mid-range, breadth is moderate, and yield curve is flat but not inverted—indicating standard late-cycle conditions. Upbeat earnings and positive tech momentum are offset by cautious guidance in consumer sectors, suggesting selective positioning is favored.*
