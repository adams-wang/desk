### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.22) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_10 falling (-5.3% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 7.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. High short interest (23.2%, 9.3 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 7.09 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (6.0x), low leverage (D/E 0.36). Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 2 selling).
