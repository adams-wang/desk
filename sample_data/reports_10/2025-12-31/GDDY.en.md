**1. Here’s Why Diamond Hill Mid-Cap Strategy Sold Fidelity National Information Services. (FIS)**
- Source: Insider Monkey | 20251231T073200 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- Diamond Hill Capital's Mid-Cap Strategy sold its position in Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) during the third quarter of 2025 due to concerns over slowing revenue growth and management's execution. The investment management company highlighted that the financial services technology company showed little progress in improving free cash flow conversion and its longer-term growth prospects in a changing banking technology environment became questionable. Despite Fidelity National Information Services being held by 57 hedge funds, Diamond Hill's conviction lies in more promising AI stocks with higher return potential.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
