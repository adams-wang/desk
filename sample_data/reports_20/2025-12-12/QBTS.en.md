- Quantum computing stocks, including IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti Computing (RGTI), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), are showing subdued pre-market activity on December 10, 2025, despite significant insider selling warnings and bubble-like valuations.

The market for these stocks is characterized by structural volatility, amplified by leveraged ETFs and active options trading, making them high-risk investments despite the long-term potential of quantum technology.
