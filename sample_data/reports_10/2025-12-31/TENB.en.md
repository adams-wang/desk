- Stifel has reiterated a Hold rating and a $35 price target on Tenable Holdings Inc. (TENB) due to adjustments in cash flow projections. These changes stem from Tenable's shift to annual billing from multi-year deals, impacting Calculated Current Billings and cash flow, but not Remaining Performance Obligations. Despite this, Tenable recently secured a OneGov agreement with the US General Services Administration to provide its FedRAMP-authorized Cloud Security solution.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
