Despite significant AI infrastructure expansion, including a $300 billion cloud computing agreement with OpenAI and new AI offerings, the company faces concerns regarding execution, high capital expenditures, and increased debt levels. Investors are advised to consider holding the stock or waiting for a better entry point due to premium valuations and intense competition in the cloud market.
