- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251216T140119 | Neutral | Relevance: 65%
- Barclays upgraded Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) to Overweight, citing its strong index options engine, increased retail options activity, and a sharpened focus on core derivatives. Despite a strong performance year-to-date and near-record highs, the stock's valuation is a key debate, showing a narrative fair value of $262.08 (moderately undervalued) versus a DCF model's $201 (overvalued). The narrative emphasizes Cboe's double-digit revenue growth in Data Vantage and operational efficiencies, while the DCF model suggests potential overvaluation if growth or margins underperform.
