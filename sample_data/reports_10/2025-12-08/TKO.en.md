**1. Is Taseko Mines (TSX:TKO) Overvalued After Its Strong Share Price Momentum?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251207T100216 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  Taseko Mines (TSX:TKO) has seen significant share price momentum, climbing to $7.32 with strong returns over 30 days and one year, driven by its copper portfolio and nearing completion of the Florence Copper project. Despite this, a narrative fair value suggests Taseko Mines is 3.4% overvalued at CA$7.32 compared to CA$7.08, making its valuation contingent on ambitious growth assumptions. While its price-to-sales ratio is cheaper than the industry average, it is higher than peers and its fair ratio, indicating limited room for error if growth falters.
