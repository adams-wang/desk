- T-Mobile is implementing longer financing terms for devices, potentially extending payment plans from two to three years, mirroring changes already applied to tablets and smartwatches. While this reduces monthly payments for customers, it also locks them into T-Mobile's services for an additional year, raising concerns about increased overall costs, fees, and taxes. This move has sparked frustration among customers, who feel it's a tactic to extract more money over a longer period, similar to practices already adopted by competitors Verizon and AT&T.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
