- Source: ts2.tech | 20251202T160454 | Neutral | Relevance: 68%
- UnitedHealth Group (UNH) stock is trading around $325-326 on December 2, 2025, significantly below its 52-week high but with Wall Street maintaining a "Buy" consensus and double-digit upside potential for 2026. The article discusses a turbulent 2025 for UNH, marked by an earnings miss, regulatory scrutiny, a cyberattack, and strategic shifts like exiting Latin America, while also highlighting a Q3 beat and revised 2025 EPS guidance, positioning UNH as a high-risk, high-reward turnaround story for investors. Despite ongoing regulatory, reputational, and medical cost risks, analysts see UNH as potentially undervalued, with a long-term earnings growth target of 13-16% and a 2.7% dividend yield, making it a "battleground stock" for risk-tolerant investors.

- CVS Health is approaching a critical investor day, with UBS noting the stock is "long crowded and well liked" due to anticipation of a multi-year recovery. The market is focused on margin recovery in its Health Care Benefits, how Caremark handles contract renewals, and the stabilization of the Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness business. While UBS anticipates conservative guidance, any disappointment could lead to a sell-off, whereas modest positive news could reinforce confidence in CVS's turnaround.
