### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.41) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Heavy insider selling: $13M sold (25 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation risk: PEG 5.2x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
4. High short interest (36.7%, 2.2 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
5. Long-term trend broken: trading 20.0% below SMA200.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
