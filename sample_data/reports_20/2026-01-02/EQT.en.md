**1. Why natural gas stocks are sliding today: EQT, Range dip as mild-weather forecasts pressure U.S. gas**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260102T151151 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Natural gas stocks like EQT and Range Resources are declining due to weakening U.S. natural gas prices, influenced by mild-weather forecasts predicting lower heating demand through mid-January. A smaller-than-expected storage draw further contributes to the downward pressure on prices, suggesting ample supply for the remainder of winter. Investors are closely monitoring weather updates, storage reports, and potential disruptions at LNG export plants, which can significantly impact the supply-demand balance.

**2. EQT Corp. stock underperforms Wednesday when compared to competitors**
- Source: MarketWatch | 20251231T163000 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- EQT Corp. (EQT) stock fell by 1.89% to $53.60 on Wednesday, ending a three-day winning streak. This underperformance occurred during a generally negative trading session, with the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average also experiencing declines.

**3. EQT stock wobbles premarket as U.S. natural gas futures slide after weather-driven rally**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251231T093650 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- EQT stock experienced premarket wobbles as U.S. natural gas futures slid, following a recent rally driven by colder weather forecasts and record liquefied natural gas (LNG) export demand. The stock was down about 0.5% in extended trading, mirroring the approximately 4% drop in natural gas futures. This volatility highlights how producers' revenue is tied to natural gas prices, which are influenced by winter heating demand and strong LNG export activity.

**4. Range Resources slides as gas prices sink after EIA storage data — what traders watch next**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251231T120918 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 74%
- Range Resources shares fell by 3% following a decline in U.S. natural gas futures, triggered by a U.S. Energy Information Administration report showing a smaller-than-expected 38 billion cubic feet withdrawal from storage. This data suggests weaker heating demand than anticipated, impacting gas-heavy producers. Traders are now focusing on incoming weather forecasts and future EIA storage updates to determine if the futures curve will stabilize or continue to drop.

**5. Caesars Stock Down 30% This Past Year but One Fund Is Wagering $29 Million on a Turnaround**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20260101T223455 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 62%
- Pennsylvania-based Quaker Capital Investments significantly increased its stake in Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) during the third quarter, adding 279,390 shares, bringing its total holding to 1.08 million shares valued at $29.28 million. This investment comes despite Caesars' stock being down 30% over the past year and the company reporting a net loss in the third quarter. Quaker Capital's move suggests a long-term view, betting on Caesars' irreplaceable real estate, growing digital presence, and active debt reduction for a future turnaround.
