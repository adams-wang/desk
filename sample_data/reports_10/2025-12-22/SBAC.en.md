**1. Prediction: This Data Center REIT Could Double as AI Demand Soars**
- Source: Finviz | 20251221T140751 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 61%
- Digital Realty Trust (DLR), a data center REIT, is poised for significant growth, potentially doubling its stock price within five years due to soaring demand from AI and quantum computing. Despite a recent slowdown in growth and past competition, increasing revenue and operating income, along with falling interest rates making expansion cheaper, are expected to bolster its performance. The company’s continued investments in new facilities and a generous dividend yield further support this positive outlook.
