**5. 2026 Could Be Explosive For The SPDR Dow Jones REIT, And It’s 4% Dividend**
- Source: 24/7 Wall St. | 20251220T161007 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 79%
- The SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR) holds $1.7 billion in assets and offers a roughly 4% dividend, though it has lagged the broader market with only 3% gains year-to-date. Goldman Sachs projects two more Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2026, which could significantly benefit REITs by reducing borrowing costs and making their dividends more attractive. While RWR's top holdings like Welltower show strong investor optimism, its valuation raises questions, and investors might consider the iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (USRT) as a larger, lower-cost alternative.
