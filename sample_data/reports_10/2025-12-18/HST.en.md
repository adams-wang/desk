**1. Assessing DiamondRock Hospitality (DRH) Valuation After Recent 3‑Month Share Price Outperformance**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251216T210846 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- DiamondRock Hospitality (DRH) has seen its shares rise 15% in the past three months, outperforming many real estate peers, as investors reconsider hotel-focused REITs. Despite this recent outperformance, the company is still considered 2.8% undervalued with a fair value estimate of $9.59, driven by repositioning projects and anticipated RevPAR growth. However, persistent softness in resort RevPAR and urban expense pressures pose potential risks to this optimistic valuation.
