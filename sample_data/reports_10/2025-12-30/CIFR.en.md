### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.92) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_10 falling (-2.6% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Heavy insider selling: $66M sold (19 transactions in 90 days).
4. Valuation stretched: PEG 9.9x requires aggressive growth execution.
5. High short interest (19.8%, 1.5 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

Insider selling cluster ($66.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).
