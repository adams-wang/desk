- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20251208T160816 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
-  General Motors is reassessing its EV manufacturing strategy due to evolving regulatory frameworks and reduced consumer incentives, which have led to underutilized EV capacity. The company decided to switch its Orion Assembly plant back to internal combustion engine vehicle production and sell its joint venture battery cell plant. Despite a $1.6 billion charge in Q3 and an anticipated charge in Q4 related to BrightDrop, GM expects these adjustments to significantly reduce EV-related losses by 2026.

-  General Motors (GM) is highlighted as a strong value stock, trading near a 52-week high but still at a low valuation of 7X forward earnings and less than 1X forward sales. The company's success is attributed to robust financial results, aggressive share buybacks, and successful restructuring in China, alongside significant investments and progress in the EV market. GM has become the second-leading EV seller in the domestic market, further bolstered by its joint venture in lithium production and consistently positive EPS revisions and a rising dividend.
