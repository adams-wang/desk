- Early-detection blood tests for cancer, such as Galleri, are gaining popularity despite not being approved by federal regulators. While companies like GRAIL are pushing for wider adoption and Medicare coverage, the medical community expresses concerns due to limited research on their effectiveness and potential for false positives or a false sense of security.
