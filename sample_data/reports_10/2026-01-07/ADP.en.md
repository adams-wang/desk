- The ADP Employment Change report for December is anticipated to show an increase of 45,000 US private payrolls, a rebound from November's net loss. This report is crucial for investors as it precedes the Nonfarm Payrolls and could significantly impact the US Dollar and Federal Reserve's rate path, especially amid ongoing debate about the US labor market and monetary policy. The US Dollar Index is currently showing a frail recovery, and the ADP data could either strengthen it or push it further down depending on the outcome.

- Automatic Data Processing (ADP) shares are trading near 52-week lows, prompting reevaluation of its valuation despite a strong dividend growth record, new AI-enabled HCM upgrades, and reaffirmed financial guidance. Analysts suggest ADP may be undervalued, with an intrinsic value of $387.77 per share based on discounted cash flow modeling, though this hinges on successful AI integration and margin normalization.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
