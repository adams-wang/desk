- According to the Financial Times, Chevron Corp and Quantum Energy Partners are planning to jointly bid for the international assets of the sanctioned Russian oil company Lukoil PJSC. The portfolio, valued at US$22 billion, includes oil and gas production, refining facilities, and filling stations, which Chevron and Quantum would split if successful.

**3. Chevron lines up 11 ships as Venezuela’s dark fleet vanishes**
- Source: The Edge Malaysia | 20260107T050839 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Chevron is set to significantly increase its Venezuelan oil exports, with 11 ships scheduled to arrive, making it the sole exporter after the ouster of President Nicolas Maduro by US forces. This move comes as the US aims to gain "total access" to Venezuela's oil reserves, with Chevron operating under a special license amid American sanctions. The increased exports will help alleviate a domestic oil glut in Venezuela caused by export backlogs and a naval blockade, and it places Chevron in a key position as the US seeks new investments to revive Venezuela's oil production.

- Chevron is sending a fleet of 11 tankers to Venezuela, positioning itself as the sole exporter of Venezuelan oil following US actions against President Nicolas Maduro.

The company is operating under a US Treasury Department license amidst sanctions.

**5. Chevron stock falls after Venezuela oil loading stalls, erasing CVX rally**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260106T170800 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Chevron Corp (CVX) shares dropped 4.4% after hours following news that Venezuela loaded crude only for Chevron while state-run PDVSA's loadings for China remained stalled. This uncertainty regarding Venezuelan oil flows, coupled with forecasts for ample global oil supply in 2026, pressured oil prices and energy stocks. Investors are now looking to Chevron's upcoming earnings report for clearer signals on its Venezuela exposure and cash returns.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
