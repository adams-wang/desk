- Source: Tekedia | 20251220T110805 | Neutral | Relevance: 65%
- MSCI is contemplating the exclusion of companies with significant cryptocurrency holdings from its major indexes if digital assets constitute over 50% of their total assets, a move primarily targeting "digital asset treasury" firms like MicroStrategy (MSTR/Strategy). This potential reclassification is driven by concerns that these companies function more as investment funds than traditional operating businesses. While MicroStrategy retained its spot in the Nasdaq 100, a final decision from MSCI is expected by January 15, 2026, which could lead to substantial passive outflows from index-tracking funds if implemented.
