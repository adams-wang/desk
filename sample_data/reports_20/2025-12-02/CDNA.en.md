- Source: Sahm | 20251201T034428 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- CareDx, Inc.'s shares have recently gained 25%, but the stock is still down 27% over the last year. Despite its low price-to-sales ratio of 2.6x compared to the biotech industry average, the company's revenue growth has been sluggish (14% last year, 12% over three years) and is projected to grow by only 13% annually over the next three years, significantly trailing the industry's predicted 128% growth. This disparity in revenue outlook explains the subdued P/S ratio, indicating investors do not expect a significant improvement.
