- Tilray Brands (TLRY) stock has plummeted recently, moving from $23.15 to $7.20, and is nearing a "death cross" pattern, indicating a bearish trend. The decline is attributed to a lack of cannabis reclassification progress from Donald Trump and headwinds in Tilray's beverage business, despite some positive results in cannabis revenue and debt reduction. The stock's future performance hinges on potential policy changes regarding cannabis reclassification.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
