Despite recent share price declines, the company's valuation is still considered undervalued by analysts, with a narrative fair value significantly above its current trading price. The upside potential hinges on unpredictable outage-driven demand and a successful turnaround in its clean energy segment.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (LOW confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows NORMAL regime with improving risk appetite and AGGRESSIVE bias. Sector rotation shows mixed signals with no clear offensive/defensive leadership, creating neutral rotation despite L1's aggressive stance. Tech leadership aligns with AI infrastructure themes in L1 context.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nPre-calculated signals validated: 4 NEUTRAL (zones E), 4 WEAKENING (zones B), 3 AVOID (zones D). No anomalies vs thresholds. Signal distribution shows lack of strong bullish signals despite improving macro backdrop.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: E (4 sectors - noise range), B (4 sectors - weakening), D (3 sectors - ignition/avoid). No sectors in strong A/F momentum zones. Rotation direction is mixed with no clear leadership pattern emerging.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nL1 AGGRESSIVE vs L2 NEUTRAL resolved by recognizing early stage of potential rotation. Improving VIX and tech rally support L1 view, but sector momentum hasn't fully materialized yet. News context shows AI/infrastructure themes supporting gradual improvement.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nIdentified EARLY_EXPANSION based on Tech leadership and defensive sector weakness, but confidence is LOW due to lack of broad cyclical participation. Traditional early expansion leaders (Financials, Industrials) are weakening rather than strengthening, suggesting cycle transition may be incomplete or stalled.\n\nKey Insight: Market is in a transitional phase where improving macro conditions haven't yet translated into clear sector leadership patterns - Technology's AI infrastructure strength provides the only consistent bullish theme while traditional cyclicals pause after recent gains."
