**1. Oracle’s AI Expansion Hits Snag As Key Investor Pulls Back: Report**
- Source: Stocktwits | 20251217T140811 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Oracle faces a setback in its AI data center expansion as Blue Owl Capital, a major funding partner, withdrew from a $10 billion investment for a new facility. The withdrawal is due to concerns over Oracle's rising debt and rapid spending on AI infrastructure, leaving the project's financing in limbo. This highlights pressure on Oracle's AI strategy, as the company's debt has grown to $105 billion, and its debt-to-equity ratio stands at 4.3.

**2. Oracle’s stock falls on a fear one analyst says should be ‘almost irrelevant’**
- Source: MarketWatch | 20251217T124900 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Oracle's stock experienced a decline after the Financial Times reported that its primary data-center partner, Blue Owl Capital, would not fund its $10 billion Michigan data center. Despite this, some Wall Street experts believe the selloff is an overreaction.

**3. Why Oracle’s stock — and its bonds — can’t shake off AI spending fears**
- Source: MarketWatch | 20251215T111200 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Oracle's stock and bonds are under pressure due to investor concerns about the company's artificial-intelligence investment financing. Following a recent earnings report, Oracle's shares have fallen about 15%, and its credit-default swaps have surged to levels not seen since the financial crisis. This indicates a worsening investor sentiment regarding Oracle's credit risk and financial plans for AI.

**4. Oracle keeps Outperform rating at Mizuho with $400 target**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251215T101700 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Mizuho maintained its Outperform rating for Oracle Corp. (ORCL) with a $400 price target, highlighting the company's long-term growth potential despite mixed recent fiscal second-quarter results. Oracle's cloud revenue aligned with forecasts, and the company's new AI infrastructure finance strategy, including customer-provided chips and GPU renting agreements, aims to optimize capital investment. Mizuho upheld its fiscal 2026 expectations and increased fiscal 2027 estimates, viewing current valuation levels as an attractive entry point after a recent stock dip.

- Oracle stock is facing significant volatility due to a post-earnings selloff, revised Wall Street price targets, and debates about AI infrastructure buildout returns. The company's increased capital expenditure for AI and a revenue/guidance miss in Q2 2026 have raised concerns among investors and analysts, despite strong cloud growth and a massive backlog. Oracle's financing strategies and the OpenAI data center timeline will be key factors influencing the stock's performance.
