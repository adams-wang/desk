- Barclays downgraded MGM Resorts stock from Overweight to Equalweight and lowered its price target to $38.00 from $42.00, citing concerns about soft leisure demand trends in Las Vegas. The downgrade reflects Barclays' assessment that Las Vegas's value proposition is under scrutiny due to hotel pricing remaining significantly higher than 2019 levels, despite the stock's relatively cheap valuation.
