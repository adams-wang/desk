- Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 alongside its peer Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (WTW) over various periods. Despite being a large-cap stock in the insurance industry with a $63.6 billion market cap, AJG's stock has declined considerably from its all-time high, exacerbated by a Q3 earnings miss. Analysts, however, maintain a "Moderate Buy" rating, projecting a substantial upside potential for the stock.

Miskel, acquired 162.536 shares of common stock at $246.1 per share through the company's Director Deferral Plan on December 1, 2025. This transaction increased the director's beneficial ownership to 9,110.532 shares, reflecting an election to defer annual cash retainers into deferred share units. This mechanism aligns the director's compensation with the company's share performance, according to the SEC Form 4 filing.

- Investor comfort with insurance-linked securities (ILS) is crucial for their growth in Asia, despite the nascent market. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is launching a new grant scheme from January 2026 to December 2028 to incentivize ILS issuances, particularly for property catastrophe bonds covering Asia-Pacific risks. While ILS has a proven track record globally, education and regulatory support are key to increasing investor adoption in Asia.
