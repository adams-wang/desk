### Technicals

MRS_5 (-0.3%) diverging from MRS_20 - short-term weakness emerging. AM_20 at 13.0% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 10.8pp, stock-specific strength. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). MACD histogram positive (0.94), confirming momentum. Volume at 59% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
