-  Alphabet's GOOGL stock is facing bearish pressure after breaking a key technical pattern, falling 4% week-to-date, as investors await the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. A hawkish stance from Chair Jerome Powell, even with a rate cut, could deepen the pullback, potentially breaking support levels at $311.3 and $305. The stock's weekly and monthly RSI being in overbought territory increases the likelihood of a correction if dovish guidance is not provided.
