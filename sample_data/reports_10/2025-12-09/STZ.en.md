- Wells Fargo has increased its price target for FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to $290 from $280 while maintaining an "Equal Weight" rating. Despite strong parcel fundamentals and projections for FedEx to exceed market expectations, Wells Fargo expressed caution due to macroeconomic uncertainty, weakness in the LTL segment, and the company's intention to manage expectations carefully. The firm noted that FedEx's stock has already seen a significant run-up of 26.5% over the past six months and is currently trading slightly above its calculated Fair Value according to InvestingPro data.

**4. MGP Ingredients, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MGPI) Price Is Right But Growth Is Lacking**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251207T043326 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
-  MGP Ingredients, Inc. currently has a low price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.9x, suggesting it might be undervalued compared to the broader Beverage industry. However, this low P/S ratio is attributed to MGP Ingredients' declining revenue, which has fallen by 22% in the last year and 24% over the past three years. Analysts forecast further revenue decline of 10% over the next year, contrasting with the industry's expected 5.0% growth, making the low P/S ratio understandable.
