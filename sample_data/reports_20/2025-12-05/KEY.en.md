The activist investor, which owns about 7.5 million KeyCorp shares, warned it may pursue a proxy fight if the board does not comply with its demands.

- HoldCo Asset Management, holding 7.5 million shares, is pushing KeyCorp to halt bank acquisitions, oust CEO Chris Gorman, and use all excess capital for share buybacks. This marks HoldCo's latest activist campaign against U.S. regional lenders, following its successful effort with Comerica and ongoing initiatives with other banks. KeyCorp's stock rose 3.2% on the news and has gained 11.5% this year, while analysts anticipate KeyCorp's CEO will address investor concerns at an upcoming conference.

**4. Activist investor calls on KeyCorp to fire CEO, pursue share buybacks**

- HoldCo Asset Management, a Florida-based activist investor, is urging KeyCorp's board to fire CEO Chris Gorman and implement a "no acquisitions" policy, directing all excess capital to share buybacks. HoldCo, which owns 7.5 million shares of Key stock, claims Gorman's leadership has led to depressed stock value and diluted shareholder equity. KeyCorp responded by stating their focus is on driving shareholder value through disciplined growth, profitability, and capital return.

**5. Investor wants KeyBank CEO fired**
- Source: Banking Dive | 20251205T180832 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management is urging KeyBank to fire CEO Chris Gorman, implement a "no acquisitions" policy, and prioritize share buybacks and shareholder returns due to what it calls Gorman's "mystifying reluctance to deploy capital into buybacks" and inconsistent M&A statements. HoldCo, which owns 0.7% of KeyBank, also questioned the intentions behind Scotiabank's nearly 15% stake in KeyBank, suggesting it resembles a "stealth acquisition" rather than a passive investment. The investor argues that KeyBank's capital deployment strategy and past acquisition decisions have led to shareholder value destruction and that shareholders desire either an outright sale to a larger bank or a focus on returning capital.
