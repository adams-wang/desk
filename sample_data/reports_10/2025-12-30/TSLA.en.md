**1. Tesla broadcasts downbeat sales estimates in unusual move**
- Source: The Detroit News | 20251230T173400 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Tesla Inc. has taken the unusual step of publishing sales estimates indicating a more conservative outlook for its vehicle deliveries than many investors anticipated. The company's projections show an average analyst estimate of 422,850 deliveries for the fourth quarter, a 15% decrease from the previous year, and a decline in annual sales for the second consecutive year. This move is considered unusual for Tesla, which has historically kept such aggregated figures private.

- Tesla's shares fell by 3.3% after its South Korean supplier, L&F, dramatically reduced the estimated value of its battery-material supply deal to $7,386 from an initial $2.9 billion. This revision highlights broader anxieties in the battery sector and raises questions about Tesla's "4680" battery program and the scaling of new battery technology. Investors are now looking to year-end autonomy headlines and an early-January delivery update for future catalysts.

- Source: ts2.tech | 20251228T150857 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Tesla (TSLA) ended the week at $475.19, with investors weighing robotaxi optionality against delivery and regulatory concerns. While robotaxi headlines are frequent, Q4 delivery forecasts around 415,000–435,000, expected on January 2nd, will provide a critical hard data point. The stock's future movement is tied to balancing optimism around autonomy with the realities of regulatory scrutiny and delivery performance.

**4. Tesla Stock Climbs Despite Gloomy Delivery Outlook**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251230T164017 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Despite a gloomy outlook on fourth-quarter vehicle deliveries, Tesla's stock saw a slight increase in early U.S. trading. Analysts predict approximately 422,850 deliveries, a 15% decrease from the previous year, with projections indicating a second consecutive year of lower deliveries for the company. However, investors appear to be focusing on Tesla's long-term ventures, such as autonomous driving and robotaxi services, contributing to the stock's overall gain of over 21% in 2025.

**5. Tesla broadcasts downbeat car sales estimates in unusual move**
- Source: Los Angeles Times | 20251230T150818 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Tesla Inc. has unusually published analyst estimates for Q4 vehicle deliveries on its website, which are more pessimistic than Bloomberg's compilation. The company's figures project a 15% year-over-year decline to 422,850 cars, while Bloomberg expects a 10% drop to 445,061. This comes as Tesla is expected to see its second consecutive annual sales decline, despite its stock performing well.
