## Sector Analysis

### Executive Summary
Cycle phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (LOW confidence). Rotation bias: NEUTRAL. Key insight: Technology is the only sector successfully breaking higher while all other sectors either consolidate or fail to launch, creating a narrow leadership environment that requires concentrated positioning rather than broad diversification.

### Market Narrative
- Technology: AI infrastructure spending, semiconductor recovery, cloud growth acceleration.
- Weakness in Energy, Industrials, Financial Services: Oil oversupply concerns, OPEC+ production uncertainty, renewable energy transition; Capital spending delays, supply chain normalization, aerospace recovery concerns.

### Rotation Summary
Current rotation shows minimal velocity with only Technology breaking out of the pack via ignition signal. Five sectors remain in neutral noise range while five others show failed ignition patterns in Zone D. This creates a bifurcated market where AI-driven Technology leads while traditional cyclicals struggle. The lack of defensive leadership (no bullish signals in XLP, XLV, XLU) combined with weak cyclical performance suggests market indecision rather than clear directional bias. Low rotation velocity indicates established trends are likely to persist.

### L1 Alignment
Sector rotation aligns with L1's NORMAL (IMPROVING) regime and AGGRESSIVE bias through Technology's ignition signal. However, the lack of broad cyclical participation reflects the MEDIUM confidence level in L1's assessment. VIX compression supporting risk appetite is evident in Technology's outperformance, while Fed meeting uncertainty explains the cautious positioning across other sectors.
