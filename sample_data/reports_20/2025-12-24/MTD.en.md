### Technicals

MRS_20 improving modestly (+0.8% over 5 days). Below STRENGTH zone by 5.1pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.13x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). MACD histogram bearish (-0.57), momentum weakening. RSI neutral at 52. Volume at 43% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +STL (Rally).

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
