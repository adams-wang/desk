**1. Costco Stock Rises After Mizuho Upgrade and Top Pick Designation**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20260105T171456 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Costco (COST) shares rose about 1% in premarket trading after Mizuho upgraded the stock to Outperform and named it a Top Pick for 2026, arguing that concerns over slowing growth are exaggerated. Mizuho analyst David Bellinger increased the price target to $1,000, citing strong membership growth, high renewal rates, and anticipated profit boosts from lower labor pressures and high single-digit sales growth. He also suggested the potential for another special dividend in fiscal 2027 due to Costco's healthy financial position.

**2. Why Costco’s stock could still get to $1,000 despite sluggish sales and membership growth**
- Source: MarketWatch | 20260105T160400 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Despite recent challenges with sluggish sales and membership growth, a Mizuho analyst believes Costco's stock could still reach $1,000. Analyst David Bellinger suggests that overcrowded stores and high consumer demand are temporary issues that Costco has successfully navigated in the past, with newer stores currently diverting traffic from established locations.

**3. Costco stock ends lower as analysts brace for a slower December sales print**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260103T163132 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Costco shares closed down 0.9% on Friday as analysts anticipate a slower December sales print, with Telsey Advisory Group forecasting comparable sales growth of 2.2% compared to 7.4% a year earlier. Investors are keenly awaiting Costco's sales update on January 7th, as well as broader economic data like U.S. employment figures and CPI reports, which could influence the stock's performance and broader market sentiment. The focus will be on core merchandise comps and online growth once gas prices and currency fluctuations are factored out.

**4. Costco stock slips after hours as investors brace for December sales report**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260103T001717 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Costco's shares fell by about 0.9% after hours on Friday, ahead of its December sales report due next week. A Telsey note maintained a bullish rating but predicted significantly slower December comparable sales growth, prompting investors to scrutinize traffic, average spend, and digital sales for insights into early 2026 demand. The sales report is crucial for gauging holiday demand and momentum, with specific attention on whether an expected slowdown impacts U.S. traffic, average ticket size, or digital growth.

**5. Costco Stock Rises After Mizuho Upgrade and Top Pick Designation**
- Source: GuruFocus | 20260105T170815 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Costco Wholesale Corp. shares rose after Mizuho upgraded the stock to Outperform and named it a Top Pick for 2026, setting a new price target of $1,000. Analyst David Bellinger dismissed concerns about slowing growth, attributing a recent stock drop to timing issues rather than fundamental problems. The upgrade anticipates strong future profits due to membership growth, effective warehouse strategies, and potential for a special dividend in 2027.
