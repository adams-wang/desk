### Key Risks

1. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.7x requires aggressive growth execution.
2. Elevated short interest (14.9%): bears positioning against stock.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.73 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 17.5x stretched relative to 5% growth. Quality metrics strong (ROE 21%, margin 21%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (3.0x). Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 5 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 stable at 5.2% (minimal 5-day change). Currently in lower STRENGTH zone (4.0-10.0%), cross-sectional ranking at 86th percentile. MRS_5 at 1.5% confirms short-term momentum alignment. AM_20 at 7.7% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 6.6pp, stock-specific strength. Below SMA200 (1.00x), long-term trend not supportive. Elevated volume (2.0x 20MA), institutional activity likely. OFD pattern: +MTN (Rally).

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX near 15th percentile of 52-week range signals calm conditions, while modest yield curve steepening (54bps 10Y-3M) suggests healthy growth expectations. Breadth at 52% indicates selective participation rather than broad-based momentum.*
