**1. Assessing Realty Income’s (O) Valuation After Its Recent Steady Share Price Climb**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251216T204150 | Neutral | Relevance: 65%
- Realty Income (O) has seen a steady share price increase, attracting income investors due to reliable dividends and improving earnings. While a dividend discount model suggests it is modestly undervalued with a fair value of $61.26, its P/E ratio of 55.5x is considerably higher than industry averages, hinting at potential overvaluation from an earnings perspective. Investors are encouraged to consider both valuation methods and assess potential risks and opportunities.
