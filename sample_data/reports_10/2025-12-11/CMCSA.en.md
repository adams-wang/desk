-  Comcast Corporation (CMCSA) faces pressure from domestic broadband customer losses but is strategically pivoting towards high-growth areas like Xfinity Mobile and Peacock streaming. This article examines price-target forecasts through 2030, analyzes Wall Street sentiment, and breaks down the bullish and bearish outlooks, considering both ongoing challenges and potential growth drivers like Universal Parks.

**2. Comcast Says Company Is 'Better' for Submitting WBD Bid**

-  Comcast President Mike Cavanagh stated that while the company's bid for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) had a low likelihood of success due to its lighter cash component, the process of exploring the acquisition made Comcast "better." He noted that the offer, focused on equity and substantial ownership in a combined entity, would have expanded Comcast's streaming ambitions globally. Despite WBD ultimately accepting Netflix's $82.7 billion cash and stock deal, Cavanagh believes Comcast's current strategy across theme parks, broadcasting, film, and streaming constitutes a "damn good hand."
