  "cycle_reasoning": "Early expansion classification based on Technology leadership emerging from oversold levels, but confidence remains low due to lack of broad cyclical participation. Traditional early expansion sectors (XLF, XLI) are failing to participate, while defensive sectors show no strength. This suggests either a very nascent expansion phase or a false signal requiring confirmation.",
  "rotation_analysis": "Current rotation shows minimal velocity with only Technology breaking out of the pack via ignition signal. Five sectors remain in neutral noise range while five others show failed ignition patterns in Zone D. This creates a bifurcated market where AI-driven Technology leads while traditional cyclicals struggle. The lack of defensive leadership (no bullish signals in XLP, XLV, XLU) combined with weak cyclical performance suggests market indecision rather than clear directional bias. Low rotation velocity indicates established trends are likely to persist.",
  "l1_alignment": "Sector rotation aligns with L1's NORMAL (IMPROVING) regime and AGGRESSIVE bias through Technology's ignition signal. However, the lack of broad cyclical participation reflects the MEDIUM confidence level in L1's assessment. VIX compression supporting risk appetite is evident in Technology's outperformance, while Fed meeting uncertainty explains the cautious positioning across other sectors.",
  "key_insight": "Technology is the only sector successfully breaking higher while all other sectors either consolidate or fail to launch, creating a narrow leadership environment that requires concentrated positioning rather than broad diversification.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (LOW confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 NORMAL (IMPROVING) regime with AGGRESSIVE bias aligns with Technology ignition signal. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 supports risk appetite seen in XLK outperformance. No hard blocks identified.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nPre-calculated signals validated: 1 IGNITION (XLK), 5 NEUTRAL (noise range), 5 AVOID (failed ignition). No anomalies detected vs empirical thresholds. Technology's +0.76% MRS_5 confirms ignition validity.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nZone D active with 6 sectors but only XLK showing positive momentum. Zone E contains 5 sectors in noise range. No Zone A/F momentum or Zone C recovery signals. Rotation direction is MIXED with Technology leading.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo L1 vs L2 conflict - both suggest selective positioning. News context supports Technology leadership via AI infrastructure themes while explaining cyclical weakness through economic uncertainty and Fed meeting proximity.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nEarly expansion classification based on Technology leadership emerging from oversold levels, but confidence remains low due to lack of broad cyclical participation. Traditional early expansion sectors (XLF, XLI) are failing to participate, while defensive sectors show no strength.
