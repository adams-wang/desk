**1. 3 Stocks Likely to Gain From Rising HSA Contribution & Medicare Premium**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251230T120748 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- The article discusses how rising Health Savings Account (HSA) contribution limits and increased Medicare premiums in 2026 are expected to impact healthcare financing and medical device demand. It highlights three companies—DexCom (DXCM), ResMed (RMD), and Masimo (MASI)—that are well-positioned to benefit from these shifts due to their focus on chronic disease management and cost-effective medical technologies. The changes could encourage greater adoption of devices that reduce long-term healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.

**2. 2 Growth Stocks to Buy For 2026 and Beyond**
- Source: Finviz | 20251230T150903 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 81%
- This article recommends Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) and DexCom (NASDAQ: DXCM) as two growth stocks to consider for 2026 and beyond. Vertex faces setbacks but has promising pipeline candidates and recent product launches like Journavx, while DexCom, a leader in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), is expanding its market despite some product recalls and concerns about new diabetes treatments. Both companies are positioned for long-term growth through new product launches and market expansion.

**3. Medtronic stock slips as year-end trading thins and Fed minutes loom**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251230T043059 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- Medtronic shares closed down 0.4% at $96.15 as year-end trading thins, with investors de-risking and awaiting fresh clues on interest rates from upcoming Federal Reserve minutes. The medical-device maker's decline is attributed to macro positioning rather than company-specific news, though its diabetes business, MiniMed, has filed for an IPO. Investors are also looking ahead to Medtronic's fiscal Q3 2026 earnings report on February 17.
