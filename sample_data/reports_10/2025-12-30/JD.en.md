- HSBC has reduced its price target for JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) to $37 from $39, citing weaker home appliance sales trends, despite maintaining a Buy rating. The bank expects a 3% year-over-year revenue decline for JD Retail in Q4 2025 and has trimmed overall revenue and earnings estimates for 2025-2027 due to softer demand and margin dilution from a revenue mix shift, particularly from food delivery investments. Despite these adjustments, JD.com is considered undervalued by InvestingPro, currently trading at $29.40 with a strong cash position.

- US-listed Chinese tech stocks, including Alibaba, JD.com, and PDD Holdings, experienced declines on Monday, mirroring losses in Hong Kong equities. This downturn was attributed to thin holiday trading and weak economic data from China, particularly a sharper-than-expected fall in industrial profits. Despite this recent pullback, Alibaba has seen significant year-to-date gains, driven by its cloud computing and AI initiatives.
