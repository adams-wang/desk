**2. Platinum's Impressive Ascent Could Continue Through 2026**

- Platinum is experiencing a significant bull market, with its price rising 94% in 2025 to US$1,766 per ounce, driven by strong industrial demand, a role in green energy, and limited supply. Experts predict this ascent will continue through 2026, with forecasts reaching as high as US$2,340 per ounce, as the market faces a persistent structural deficit due to production constraints and increasing demand from sectors like hydrogen energy, alongside China's reclassification of platinum as a strategic critical mineral. Several companies, including Platinum Group Metals, Eastern Platinum, and Valterra Platinum, are poised to benefit from these favorable market dynamics.

**4. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE): Revisiting Valuation After New Expero Data Deal and Strong November Trading Metrics**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251214T142423 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 61%
- Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is gaining attention due to a new data deal with Expero and strong November trading metrics. Despite a modest one-year return, ICE's shares appear undervalued according to analysis, with a fair value estimated at $190.29 versus its current price of $163.21. The narrative suggests continued growth through expanding data partnerships and electronic trading platforms, though risks like energy market downturns or integration issues with mortgage tech deals could impact future performance.
