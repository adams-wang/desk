- Brown & Brown Inc. has filed a lawsuit alleging that 29 former top employees conspired with British-based insurer Howden U.S. Services LLC to orchestrate a "mass employee raid," targeting 200 of its workers across multiple states. The lawsuit claims this move was strategically timed over the holidays "to inflict maximum competitive harm" and accuses the defendants of trade secret theft, contractual breaches, and unfair competition. This is not the first time Howden U.S. Services has been accused of poaching workers, with at least three other insurers filing similar lawsuits.

- Source: Finimize | 20251224T140812 | Neutral | Relevance: 60%
- Brown & Brown Inc. (NYSE: BRO) has pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy, leading to record revenues but also increased debt and integration costs, causing its stock to underperform the S&P 500. While its M&A engine drives top-line growth, organic growth has slowed and its valuation trades at a premium compared to peers. Investors are monitoring the company's ability to manage debt, integrate acquisitions effectively, and deliver on earnings to justify its higher multiple.
