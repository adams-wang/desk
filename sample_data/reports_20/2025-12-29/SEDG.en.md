### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -2.3% to -4.5% (-2.1% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 8.4pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -4.1% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 4.8pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.10x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 41. Volume at 48% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -SUL (Resistance).

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
