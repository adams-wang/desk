**1. How AI Data Center Scrutiny and Governance Shifts At DTE Energy (DTE) Have Changed Its Investment Story**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251212T110822 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- DTE Energy recently updated bylaws, announced an executive retirement, increased dividends, and became central to a Michigan regulatory review regarding power contracts for a US$7.00 billion AI data center. This combination of governance shifts and data center scrutiny highlights how regulatory oversight and political pressure are increasingly impacting DTE's growth ambitions and long-term capital planning. The unresolved regulatory review poses a near-term risk to DTE's capital plan and investment narrative by introducing uncertainty about the timing and approval of power contracts essential for future growth.

**2. DTE Energy upgraded at Jefferies as rising data center load to boost earnings**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251211T160813 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Jefferies upgraded DTE Energy to Buy from Neutral, citing that the utility is poised to benefit from increased data center demand, which is expected to elevate its earnings growth above 8% annually through 2030. The brokerage increased its price target to $150 and expects an 8.1% EPS compound annual growth rate for 2026-2030, driven by the addition of 1.5 gigawatts of data center load to its model. DTE's shares are currently trading at a discount compared to peers, presenting an attractive entry point according to Jefferies.

**3. DTE Energy Partners with ISN® to Upscale Contractor Qualification and Enhance Risk Management Process**

**4. Michigan Regulators Blow Past DTE Energy’s Data Center Deadline**
- Source: WHMI | 20251210T050839 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) failed to approve DTE Energy's power contracts for the Oracle and Open AI data center by the utility's December 5th deadline, despite DTE's warning of project cancellation if not met. DTE declined to comment on the project's status post-deadline, while the MPSC cited that cases are added to the agenda when "ripe for a decision." This inaction has caused further controversy around the massive $7 billion data center project, which faces significant public opposition and calls for a contested case due to concerns about energy costs, environmental impact, and transparency.
