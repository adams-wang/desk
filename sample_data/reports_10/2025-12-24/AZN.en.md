- AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo's Enhertu has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in the US for adult patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who have residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant treatment and a high risk of recurrence. This marks Enhertu's tenth BTD, based on the DESTINY-Breast05 Phase III trial results which demonstrated impressive clinical benefit over the current standard of care. The designation aims to accelerate the development and regulatory review of Enhertu, potentially making it an important treatment option to reduce recurrence and prevent progression to metastatic disease for these patients.

- AstraZeneca has filed a lawsuit against the US government, challenging the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' determination of drugs eligible for Medicare price negotiations. The pharmaceutical giant's complaint alleges that the definition of "qualifying single source drugs" under the Biden-era plan is unlawful, especially after one of its cancer treatments was selected for the program's second cycle.

VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
