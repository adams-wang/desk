- Hollywood is in turmoil as Netflix and Paramount battle to acquire Warner Bros, a historic studio whose potential sale signals further upheaval and job losses in an already struggling entertainment industry. Creative workers are weighing the lesser of two evils: control by tech giant Netflix, blamed for harming movie theatres, or influence from billionaires possibly too close to President Trump via Paramount. The unfolding situation highlights broader concerns about industry consolidation and the future of film and television production.

- Investor Ross Gerber believes that entertainment conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery Inc. is a "dog asset" and is significantly overvalued in the current bidding frenzy. He estimates the company is worth no more than $15 per share, far below Netflix and Paramount's respective bids of $27.75 and $30 per share. Gerber attributes the inflated offers to the scarcity of major studio assets and the competitive bidding environment, noting that both parties are "vastly overpaying."

Zaslav, known for orchestrating the Discovery-WarnerMedia merger, attributes his success to an intense work ethic, a lesson learned from a teenage tennis experience where he vowed never to be "outworked" again.

- Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) stock is near $30 amidst a major takeover battle between Netflix's agreed-upon acquisition of its streaming and studios business, and Paramount Skydance's hostile $30 cash tender offer for the entire company. The situation is complicated by increasing antitrust scrutiny from regulators and politicians, alongside a consumer lawsuit, leading to WBD's stock performance being driven by deal probabilities and regulatory risk rather than traditional financials. Investors are now watching WBD's formal response to Paramount's offer and the ongoing regulatory developments concerning the Netflix transaction.
