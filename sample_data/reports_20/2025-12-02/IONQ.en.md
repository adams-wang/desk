### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -9.2% to -6.8% (+2.4% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 10.8pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -5.2% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 6.2pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.11x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 43. Volume at 49% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
