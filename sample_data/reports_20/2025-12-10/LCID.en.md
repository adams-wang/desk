-  Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) shares are falling after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to Underweight with a reduced price target of $10, citing concerns over the company's extended timeline to profitability and significant dilution risk. The luxury EV maker is not expected to reach gross profit breakeven until 2028, with EBIT losses persisting until 2031, compounded by a need to raise approximately $2 billion in equity by mid-2026. This downgrade adds to existing pressures from a wider-than-expected Q3 loss, executive departures, and an $875 million convertible note offering.

Despite this, institutional investors collectively own about 75.17% of LCID, with other significant holders including Vanguard Group Inc. and Swiss National Bank.

The lawsuit claims that Lucid's HR department targeted Bach after a Senior Director of Human Resources referred to him as a "German Nazi," and that Lucid failed to take appropriate remedial action.

**5. Lucid Group Stock Extends Losses Tuesday Following 'EV Winter' Downgrade**
- Source: Benzinga | 20251209T160930 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
-  Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) shares continued to fall on Tuesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to Underweight, citing an "EV winter" and concerns about Lucid's path to profitability. Analyst Andrew Percoco slashed his price target to $10 from $30, projecting the company won't reach gross profit breakeven until 2028 and may require a significant equity raise. This bearish outlook, compounded by high short interest and a recent executive departure, has pushed LCID near its 52-week low.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
