**1. Phillips 66 (PSX) breaks critical uptrend: Retracement setup or reversal signal?**

- Phillips 66 (PSX) recently broke below a critical uptrend line that had supported its stock price from June to early December. This breakdown typically signals a polarity shift, where former support transforms into new resistance, suggesting a potential short-selling opportunity if the stock rallies to the $134-136 zone. However, bulls might view a decisive reclaim of $136 as a false breakdown or "bear trap," potentially leading to renewed buying interest.
