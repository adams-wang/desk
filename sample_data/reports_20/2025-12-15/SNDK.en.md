**1. Sandisk (SNDK) Stock News Today: Downgrade Sparks Sharp Selloff, Analyst Price Targets, and 2026 Outlook (Dec. 14, 2025)**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251214T190926 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Sandisk's (NASDAQ: SNDK) stock experienced a sharp selloff on Friday, December 12, 2025, dropping 14.66% after GF Securities downgraded it to "Hold" from "Buy" and lowered its price target. This downgrade, coupled with a broader tech sector pullback driven by concerns over AI valuations, led to significant volatility. Despite the immediate drop, analysts remain divided, with some maintaining positive outlooks and increased price targets, while others like GF Securities have become more conservative, highlighting the ongoing debate about the durability of the memory upcycle and the impact of the AI storage boom.
