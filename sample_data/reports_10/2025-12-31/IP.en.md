- International Paper (IP) is gaining attention on Wall Street as a potential comeback story, despite its "boring" image. The company, a major player in packaging, containerboard, and pulp, is seen as a solid long-term investment due to its strong dividend and ties to the growing e-commerce sector, offering a steady climb rather than a volatile, meme-stock-like ride. While not a "viral brand," its role in the global shipping system makes it an attractive option for investors focused on passive income and stability rather than short-term hype.

- US materials stocks, including steelmakers and packaging manufacturers, are projected to achieve their highest earnings growth in five years, rising 20% in 2026, primarily due to tariffs and strategic volume plays. Metals and packaging industries are expected to see the most significant boost, with earnings growth over 30%, driven by trade protections strengthening steel prices and increasing demand for consumer goods packaging. While tariffs create headwinds for some, cost-cutting measures and anticipated interest rate cuts are also contributing factors across the broader materials sector.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
