- Tilray Brands (TLRY) stock has plummeted recently, moving from $23.15 to $7.20, and is nearing a "death cross" pattern, indicating a bearish trend. The decline is attributed to a lack of cannabis reclassification progress from Donald Trump and headwinds in Tilray's beverage business, despite some positive results in cannabis revenue and debt reduction. The stock's future performance hinges on potential policy changes regarding cannabis reclassification.
