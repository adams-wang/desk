**4. Alphabet: Reports Indicate That Company Is Considering Ads Within Gemini in 2026**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251209T101615 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- Alphabet is reportedly planning to introduce ads within its AI chatbot, Gemini, by 2026, which could be a significant value-additive move for the company given Gemini's 650 million monthly users. This strategy aims to monetize the AI tool through advertising, similar to Google Search's successful model, rather than relying solely on subscriptions. Morningstar maintains its $340 fair value estimate for Alphabet, anticipating potential upside if the ad integration proves successful in growing the user base and providing high returns for advertisers.

**5. Alphabet stock price is at risk of deeper pullback if Powell signals end of rate cuts**
- Source: Traders Union | 20251210T120845 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
-  Alphabet's GOOGL stock is facing bearish pressure after breaking a key technical pattern, falling 4% week-to-date, as investors await the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. A hawkish stance from Chair Jerome Powell, even with a rate cut, could deepen the pullback, potentially breaking support levels at $311.3 and $305. The stock's weekly and monthly RSI being in overbought territory increases the likelihood of a correction if dovish guidance is not provided.
