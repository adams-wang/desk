- American International Group (NYSE:AIG) currently has a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.5x, suggesting potential bullish signals compared to the broader market.

The article concludes that the low P/E reflects investor sentiment about limited future growth potential, hindering a significant share price increase.
