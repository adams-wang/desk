-  Royal Caribbean Group is introducing "Points Choice" in early 2026, a new loyalty program that allows travelers to earn nights across Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea, and choose which brand's loyalty program receives the credit. This change is being met with enthusiasm by fans, as it provides greater flexibility and prevents loyalty progress from being split when guests try different cruise lines within the group. While past cruises won't merge and existing points can't be combined across brands for instant tier jumps, the program is seen as a positive development offering more choice to consumers.

Additionally, accessible staterooms are well-designed with ample space and features like automatic doors and L-shaped shower seats.
