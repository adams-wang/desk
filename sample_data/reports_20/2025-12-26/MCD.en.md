- McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) is facing Christmas Day 2025 with two key considerations: store operating hours, which vary by franchise, and a significant strategic shift for 2026 focused on reinforcing "value leadership" through enhanced global franchising standards. Wall Street analysts project modest upside, with price targets generally in the low-to-mid $300s, while the company continues to be viewed as a stable cash-return story due to its asset-light franchise model and consistent dividend increases. The new value-focused standards aim to address consumer spending caution observed in 2025 and ensure consistent customer experience.
