**1. Edison International (EIX): Valuation Check After Sharp Share Price Drop on Wildfire Liability Fears**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251208T010840 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
-  Edison International (EIX) is experiencing renewed interest due to a significant share price drop stemming from new wildfire liability concerns related to the Eaton Fire. Despite a recent dip, the stock has shown positive returns over three months and five years, indicating long-term investor confidence. Analysts suggest EIX is undervalued, with a fair value estimate significantly above its current trading price, attributing potential upside to policy-driven electrification and regulatory protections, though wildfire liabilities remain a key risk.

**2. UBS Raises Edison International (EIX) Price Target to $70, Keeps Buy Rating**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251210T015525 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
-  UBS has increased its price target for Edison International (EIX) to $70 from $66 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. This revision comes after Edison International reported strong third-quarter core EPS and revenue growth, partly driven by the approval of SB 254 which helps cover wildfire liabilities. The company reaffirmed its core EPS growth target of 5% to 7% through 2028.

**3. Is Edison International a Bargain After Wildfire Risk Headlines and a 27% Share Price Slide?**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251208T100600 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 98%
-  Edison International's share price has significantly dropped, down 27.4% year-to-date, amidst concerns over wildfire risk and regulatory developments. Despite this, Simply Wall St's analysis suggests the stock is undervalued, scoring 5/6 on valuation checks. Both Discounted Cash Flow and Price-to-Earnings analyses indicate a substantial discount compared to its intrinsic value and industry peers, prompting a closer look for value investors.

**4. Is Edison International Stock Underperforming the Nasdaq?**
- Source: inkl | 20251208T180813 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Edison International (EIX) stock has underperformed the Nasdaq, falling 31.8% over the past year compared to Nasdaq's 18.5% gain, and 28.3% year-to-date while the Nasdaq returned 21.9%. Despite reporting better-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS, the stock dropped due to increased core loss in its parent and other segments, higher interest expenses, and reduced fiscal 2025 core EPS guidance. Analysts, however, maintain a "Moderate Buy" rating with a target price suggesting a 15.3% premium.

**5. Is Edison’s Lowered 2025 EPS Guidance Amid Clean Energy Spend Altering The Investment Case For EIX?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251209T211642 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  Edison International recently cut its 2025 core EPS guidance due to higher interest expenses and significant clean energy investments, despite stronger-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS. This adjustment reinforces the short-term pressures on the company but does not fundamentally change its long-term investment narrative centered on grid and renewables investment supported by policy. Investors need to weigh elevated capital expenditures and balance sheet flexibility against ongoing decarbonization efforts and unresolved wildfire liabilities.
