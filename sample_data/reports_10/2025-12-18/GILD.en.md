- Gilead Sciences' investigational single-tablet regimen of bictegravir and lenacapavir achieved noninferiority to its megablockbuster Biktarvy in the Artistry-2 study, marking a second late-stage trial win. This success paves the way for regulatory filings next year and could offer a new treatment option for virologically suppressed HIV patients, potentially reaching $630 million in sales by 2030 according to analysts. The new combo targets specific market segments who may prefer fewer medications or are not candidates for standard Biktarvy, expanding Gilead's market reach without cannibalization.
