**1. Affordable Trims Help Ford Grow Share in a Lower U.S. Auto Market**
- Source: Ford From the Road | 20251204T040827 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Ford managed to grow its market share by 0.5 percentage points to 13.2% through November 2025, despite an overall 7% decline in the U.S. auto market. This success is attributed to Ford's strategy of focusing on affordability, with strong sales of entry-level trims like the Maverick XL, Ranger XL, and Bronco Sport Big Bend. The company's powertrain diversification, including a record 16,301 hybrid sales in November, also contributed to its strong performance.

- Ford Motor Company has recalled nearly 12,000 Lincoln MKT vehicles from model years 2016-2019 due to a safety issue where the B-Pillar trim may detach while driving, creating a road hazard. Dealers will fix this issue free of charge, with interim notification letters for owners expected by December 8, 2025, and the final remedy available in June 2026.

- Ford has issued recalls for over 20,000 vehicles, including some manufactured at its Kentucky plants. These recalls address high-voltage battery defects in certain Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair plug-in hybrids, and issues with electric brake boosters in some Ford Maverick and Escape vehicles. As of early December, Ford has had 138 recalls in 2025, more than any other automaker.

**4. Ford’s EV Plans Ruined**
- Source: 24/7 Wall St. | 20251203T135418 | Bearish | Relevance: 97%
- Ford Motor Co.'s electric vehicle sales dropped sharply in November, with EV sales down 61% year-over-year, indicating a struggle without federal tax credits. Despite a significant investment in EVs, the company plans to refocus on gasoline-powered vehicles for now, recognizing the strong competition from Chinese manufacturers and the continued dominance of its F-Series trucks. This strategic shift comes as CEO Jim Farley acknowledges the challenges of competing in the EV market and the sustained success of Ford's traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

**5. Ford Just Reported an Absolute Collapse in Its EV Sales. That Could Be a Key Warning for Tesla Stock.**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251203T164900 | Bearish | Relevance: 97%
- Ford reported a 61% crash in all-electric vehicle sales for November, a significant drop attributed to the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. This collapse serves as a warning for the entire EV industry, including Tesla (TSLA), whose Q3 sales were also boosted by the expiring tax credit. Analysts are divided on Tesla's future, with a consensus "Hold" rating despite ambitious plans for autonomous robotaxis and humanoid robots.
