-  Some Eversource customers are expressing concern over significantly higher estimated electric bills, attributing the spikes to newly installed smart meters. One Springfield resident, Margaret Tebaldi, received an estimated bill of $720-$800 after a zero bill following a previous $200 charge, despite being on a fixed income. Eversource, however, believes the high estimate for Tebaldi is due to the bill spanning two months, not a smart meter issue.
