**1. Paul Tudor Jones Trims IREN After 300% Run, AI Story Still Intact - IREN (NASDAQ:IREN)**
- Source: Benzinga | 20251215T160937 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Paul Tudor Jones's Tudor Investment fund significantly reduced its stake in IREN after the stock surged 300%, locking in substantial profits, yet the company's AI narrative remains strong due to a major contract with Microsoft. Despite recent capital raises for expansion causing minor dilution concerns, IREN's market momentum continues, suggesting Jones's move was profit-taking rather than a lack of confidence. The company’s pivot from crypto mining to AI cloud and GPU services is highlighted by its multi-year, multi-billion dollar deal with Microsoft.

3. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
