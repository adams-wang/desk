- Goldman Sachs analyst Ryan Nash has raised the price target for Enact Holdings (ACT) to $45 from $41, maintaining a Neutral rating. Despite regional banks underperforming in 2025 due to macro concerns, Nash anticipates continued multi-year fundamental improvement in 2026 driven by solid loan growth, net interest income momentum, and positive operating leverage. However, credit risk remains a significant wildcard for the company.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
