- Despite Novo Nordisk's semaglutide failing to treat Alzheimer's disease in Phase III trials, experts see potential in further testing of GLP-1s, especially in combination therapies. The drug showed a 10% improvement in key Alzheimer's biomarkers, suggesting that adding another therapeutic could achieve a clinically significant outcome. Coya Therapeutics, among others, is advocating for combination approaches, moving towards addressing inflammation as a primary driver of neurodegenerative diseases.

- Novo Nordisk is facing a pivotal year in 2026, marked by challenges such as pricing pressures and patent expiries, especially in the crucial U.S. market. Despite its stock experiencing its worst year on record, the recent FDA approval of its oral weight-loss pill, Wegovy, offers a potential opportunity to regain investor confidence and compete with Eli Lilly. The company's ability to navigate competition from rival drugs and cheaper copycats, alongside its new leadership's performance in improving U.S. operations, will be critical for its future growth.
