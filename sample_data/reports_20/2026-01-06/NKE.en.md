**1. NIKE's Stock Looks Expensive: Is Patience the Better Strategy Now?**
- Source: Finviz | 20260105T125400 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- NIKE (NKE) stock appears expensive with a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 30.34X, exceeding the industry average, and its shares have underperformed peers recently. Despite fundamental strengths and a strategic repositioning, near-term headwinds like uneven demand, wholesale softness, and margin pressures suggest a neutral stance for investors. Prospective investors may consider waiting for a more attractive entry point, while current holders could retain the stock for long-term recovery potential.

**2. Adidas gets rare sell as Bank of America sees slowing growth**
- Source: FashionNetwork USA | 20260106T122542 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 75%
- Adidas AG shares dropped after Bank of America issued a rare "sell" rating, citing anticipated slower growth and increased competition from brands like Nike, On, Asics, and Puma. Analysts predict Adidas will return to single-digit sales growth this year, despite the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup, and have cut its price target to 160 euros. This downgrade contrasts with the majority of analysts who maintain "buy" ratings even after the stock's significant decline in 2025.

**3. Bank of America Downgrades Adidas, Flags Slower Growth Ahead**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20260106T171642 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 72%
- Bank of America analysts have double-downgraded Adidas to "underperform" from "buy," citing a potential slowdown in sales growth to single digits and increased competition from brands like Nike, On, Asics, and Puma. The move, which sent Adidas shares down, contrasts with the broader analyst optimism for the company. While the 2026 FIFA World Cup is expected to provide a temporary boost, BofA questions long-term momentum and urges caution across the sporting-goods sector, also downgrading JD Sports Fashion Plc.

**4. Deere price exits ascending secondary price channel - Forecast today - 06-01-2026**
- Source: Economies.com | 20260106T130749 | Bearish | Relevance: 70%
- Deere & Company (DE) stock price has declined, breaking below a short-term upward price channel due to negative pressure from trading below its SMA50 and incoming negative signals from the RSI. Analysts predict a continued decline, targeting the $433.00 support level as long as the price remains below the $476.50 resistance. This forecast indicates a bearish outlook for Deere in upcoming trading sessions.

**5. Adidas shares sink after double downgrade at Bank of America**
- Source: Investing.com | 20260106T090756 | Neutral | Relevance: 68%
- Adidas shares plummeted after Bank of America downgraded the stock to Underperform, cutting its price target to €160 from €213. BofA believes Adidas's turnaround story is largely priced in and anticipates a shift to lower-growth, single-digit organic sales, and normalizing margins. The bank also reduced 2027 earnings forecasts, expecting investor focus to shift to brands with more sustained growth.
