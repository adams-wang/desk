The agreement, effective January 1, 2026, will run until Macau’s current gaming concession ends in 2032 and automatically extend further if new concessions are granted. Under the updated terms, MGM China will pay a higher monthly license fee, increasing to 3.5% of its adjusted consolidated net monthly revenue, with MGM Resorts receiving two-thirds of this fee.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
