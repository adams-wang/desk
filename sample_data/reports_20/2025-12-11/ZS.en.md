**1. Zscaler, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ZS) Popularity With Investors Under Threat As Stock Sinks 26%**
- Source: 富途牛牛 | 20251210T185700 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
-  Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) has seen its stock price drop by 26% over the last month, despite a 17% gain over the past year. The company's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 13.7x is significantly higher than the Software industry average, raising concerns as analysts project Zscaler's revenue growth (20% per annum) to be lower than the broader industry (31% per year). This divergence suggests investors may be overly optimistic, potentially indicating an unsustainable valuation.

**2. Zscaler stock maintains Buy rating at Freedom Capital on strong Q1 results**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251211T161021 | Bullish | Relevance: 97%
- Freedom Capital Markets reiterated its Buy rating on Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) with a $320 price target, following the cybersecurity firm's strong Q1 fiscal 2026 results that surpassed analyst estimates. The company's revenue growth was driven by its Zero Trust Everywhere platform and AI security stack, although gross margins faced pressure from newer, lower-margin products and increased operating expenditures. Despite this, analysts predict profitability this year, and the full-year outlook has been raised.
