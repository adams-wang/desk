**1. Should New LEQEMBI Data and Subcutaneous Option Shift the Risk Profile for Biogen (BIIB) Investors?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251204T073446 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- New LEQEMBI (lecanemab) data from the CTAD conference revealed long-term "time savings" in Alzheimer's progression and a bioequivalent subcutaneous formulation, potentially enhancing treatment uptake and efficacy for Biogen (BIIB). These findings strengthen LEQEMBI's central role in Biogen's investment thesis, aiming to offset pressures in its mature product portfolio. While the data are positive, investors should remain aware of ongoing risks related to Alzheimer's uptake, reimbursement, competition, and broader pricing pressures on high-cost specialty drugs.

**2. Eisai Presents New Data on the Continued and Expanding Benefit of LEQEMBI® (lecanemab-irmb) Maintenance Treatment in Early Alzheimer’s Disease at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD) Conference 2025**

- Eisai and Biogen presented new data at the CTAD 2025 conference highlighting the long-term benefits of LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) maintenance treatment in early Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a potential to delay disease progression by up to 8.3 years in low-amyloid patients. The presentations also included new safety and efficacy data for the subcutaneous formulation of LEQEMBI for initiation treatment, which showed comparable efficacy and safety to the intravenous administration. These findings support earlier initiation of LEQEMBI to further delay disease progression and provide a convenient new treatment option for patients and care partners.
