- Lyft's P/S ratio of 1.2x is typical for the Transportation industry, despite its superior recent revenue growth. The article suggests that investors might be hesitant due to potential future volatility or unconvincing long-term growth expectations, even though analysts forecast higher growth for Lyft than the industry average. This indicates the market may be pricing in risks not immediately apparent from its P/S ratio and revenue performance.
