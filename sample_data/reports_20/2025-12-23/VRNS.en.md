**1. Assenagon Asset Management S.A. Makes New Investment in Varonis Systems, Inc. $VRNS**
- Source: MarketBeat | 20251221T160838 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Assenagon Asset Management S.A. has initiated a new stake in Varonis Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRNS) during the third quarter, acquiring 165,228 shares valued at approximately $9.5 million. This adds to significant institutional ownership, with other large investors like Norges Bank, Voya Investment Management, Goldman Sachs, RGM Capital, and Allspring Global Investments Holdings also holding substantial positions or increasing their stakes. Despite Varonis Systems being highly institutionally owned and having a "Moderate Buy" consensus rating from analysts, the company reported Q3 EPS in line with estimates but missed revenue expectations and remains unprofitable with negative margins.
