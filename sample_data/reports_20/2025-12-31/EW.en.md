### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 11 raises (avg +5%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.86 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 29.7x stretched relative to 11% growth. Quality metrics strong (margin 23%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (4.0x), low leverage (D/E 0.30). Insider selling cluster ($3.8M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI neutral at 51. Volume at 53% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -MTL (Decline).

### Position Sizing

- **Shares:** 480

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
