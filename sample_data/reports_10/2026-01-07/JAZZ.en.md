- Jazz Pharmaceuticals' stock fell 4.5% after announcing mixed Phase 3 trial results for its cancer drug Ziihera. While the drug, both with and without immunotherapy, showed improved progression-free survival, the additional immunotherapy provided only modest extra benefit, leading to a market sell-off despite analyst optimism about Ziihera's primary role in improving outcomes. The company plans to present the full data at the 2026 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
