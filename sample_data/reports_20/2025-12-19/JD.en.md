- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251218T021033 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- JD.com's shares have fallen 11.2% over the last six months, significantly underperforming its sector and industry due to concerns about profitability pressure from new investments, moderating growth in electronics, and losses from food delivery services. Despite strong user momentum and an undervalued stock at a 9.33x forward P/E, the company faces intense competition and high marketing expenses across multiple fronts. While the valuation discount reflects a transition phase, JD currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as margin recovery remains gradual and earnings visibility evolves.
