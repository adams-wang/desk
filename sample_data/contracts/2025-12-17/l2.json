  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: CONTRACTION (MEDIUM confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows RISK_OFF (DETERIORATING) regime with VIX rising +11.7% to 17.6 and narrow breadth at 52.6%. Sector rotation shows mixed pattern with 4 momentum zones (F) and 5 trend zones (A), indicating rotation into both defensive and quality growth names during risk-off conditions.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll signals validated against v6.1 thresholds. 9 bullish sectors (TREND/MOMENTUM), 1 neutral (XLU in noise zone), 1 bearish (XLK in ignition zone with negative momentum). No anomalies detected in S,V,A calculations.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: F(4 sectors)-XLP,XLB,XLF,XLY showing momentum; A(5 sectors)-XLRE,XLV,XLC,XLE,XLI showing trend; E(1)-XLU neutral; D(1)-XLK awaiting ignition. Rotation direction mixed between defensive momentum and quality trend sectors.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nL1 RISK_OFF vs L2 mixed bullish rotation resolved by recognizing flight to quality/defensive momentum. Technology weakness (XLK AVOID) aligns with AI infrastructure cost concerns mentioned in L1. Defensive sectors (XLP, XLU) and financials (XLF) leading supports risk-off thesis.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nCONTRACTION phase identified by technology sector weakness (XLK AVOID), defensive momentum leadership (XLP, XLF), and mixed rotation patterns typical of late-cycle environments. The presence of 4 momentum zones alongside 5 trend zones, combined with utilities remaining neutral despite strong momentum, suggests markets are positioning for economic deceleration.\n\nKey Insight: Technology's transition to AVOID status marks a critical inflection point, as AI infrastructure cost concerns trigger rotation away from expensive growth toward defensive momentum and financial innovation themes, signaling potential end of tech-led market leadership."
