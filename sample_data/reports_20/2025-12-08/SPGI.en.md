-  The Federal Reserve is expected to implement its third interest rate cut this week, facing a divided Federal Open Market Committee on whether to prioritize cooling inflation or bolstering the labor market. While some officials are concerned about persistently high inflation above the 2% target, others advocate for cuts due to signs of weakness in the labor market. The decision will likely be a 25-basis-point cut, followed by a potential pause, requiring Chair Jerome Powell to carefully manage expectations for 2026.
