This weakness and leadership changes are causing investor nervousness, with analysts maintaining a 'sector perform' rating and a $35 price target, as the company faces pressure to adapt its strategy amidst tighter consumer budgets and rising price sensitivity.

The deal was announced alongside Campbell's Q1 fiscal results, which showed a net sales dip of 3% but reported sales "gains" for Rao's.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
