- Solventum, a 3M spinoff, overcame initial investor unrest in 2025 by selling its purification and filtration business for $4 billion and acquiring Acera Surgical for $850 million. These strategic moves allowed the company to pay down debt, streamline its portfolio, and attract renewed investor confidence, leading to a significant turnaround in its financial performance and stock price. CEO Bryan Hanson's focus on efficiency and a decentralized structure has positioned the company for positive momentum in 2026.
