Cycle phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (LOW confidence). Rotation bias: NEUTRAL.

The lack of momentum (F) or trend (A) zones suggests markets are consolidating rather than establishing new leadership patterns.

Holiday-thinned conditions and VIX complacency explain this disconnect - underlying sector rotation shows deterioration masked by low volatility environment. Quality positioning ahead of 2026 catalysts is appropriate.
