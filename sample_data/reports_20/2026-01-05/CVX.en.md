**2. Chevron, US oil stocks jump after Trump's Venezuela comments**
- Source: Latest news from Azerbaijan | 20260105T113030 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Shares of U.S. oil companies, most notably Chevron Corp., saw a significant jump in premarket trading after President Donald Trump's comments about the U.S. planning to "run" Venezuela. This surge is due to the potential for increased U.S. control over Venezuela's vast crude reserves, with companies like Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Exxon Mobil poised to benefit, despite past expropriations and the need for significant infrastructure repairs.

**3. US-Venezuela conflict: Chevron, Exxon Mobil and other US oil company stocks surge up to 10% in pre-market trade**
- Source: mint | 20260105T110807 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- US oil companies like Chevron, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, and Valero saw significant pre-market stock gains, up to 10%, following the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. President Trump announced US plans to "run" Venezuela and that US oil companies would invest to revive its oil infrastructure, increasing output. Chevron, being the only American oil company currently operating in Venezuela, is expected to be a primary beneficiary, alongside others like Exxon Mobil who are owed significant sums from past nationalizations.

**4. Chevron, Exxon Stocks In Focus As Trump’s Venezuela Gambit After Maduro Capture Sparks Buzz Around US Oil Majors**
- Source: Stocktwits | 20260105T021312 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Following the reported capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by US forces, President Donald Trump's announcement about encouraging American companies to invest in Venezuela has sparked significant interest in US oil stocks, particularly Chevron and ExxonMobil. Retail investor sentiment for both companies surged to "extremely bullish" on Stocktwits, with Trump suggesting US firms would help rebuild Venezuela's energy infrastructure. This move could benefit companies like Chevron, which already has a presence in Venezuela.

**5. U.S. Seizure of Maduro and Venezuela Oil Assets Might Change The Case For Investing In Chevron (CVX)**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T020808 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- The U.S. seizure of Venezuelan assets and President Trump's announcement of major U.S. oil company investment in Venezuela's energy infrastructure places Chevron (CVX) in a unique and central role due to its existing operations in the country. While this creates potential for Chevron in a rebuild, it also introduces heightened political and operational risks, reinforcing existing geopolitical exposures rather than acting as a new near-term catalyst. Investors should consider the impact of these developments on Chevron's long-term investment narrative and risk profile, alongside its earnings sensitivity to commodity prices and project delivery.
