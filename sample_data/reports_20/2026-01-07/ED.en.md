- RBC Capital has initiated coverage on Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) with a Sector Perform rating and a $114.00 price target. Analyst Stephen D’Ambrisi noted New York's constructive regulatory environment and high visibility, but RBC’s estimates for 2027-2029 are 1-2% below consensus due to embedded underearning at CECONY. The firm finds Consolidated Edison's 4.5% discount to peers fair, attributing it to slower growth and fewer near-term capital opportunities, despite the company's strong dividend history.

| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
