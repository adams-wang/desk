- American Airlines shares were little changed as the year closed, influenced by oil prices' steepest annual drop since 2020 which impacts fuel costs, and winter weather disruption that led to flight cancellations. Investors are monitoring these factors as well as upcoming earnings guidance for their impact on airline profitability in the seasonally slower period after the holidays.

**5. Behind the mesh curtain: Why airline class wars will intensify in 2026**
- Source: CNBC | 20260102T120956 | Neutral | Relevance: 93%
- In 2026, the airline industry will see an intensification of class divides, with a continued focus on premium travelers through new lounges, first-class cabins, and perks. This comes as airfare is expected to remain flat and a weakening economy could disproportionately impact price-sensitive consumers and budget airlines. Companies like Delta and United are dominating profits by catering to wealthier customers, while others like Spirit Airlines face struggles and Southwest undergoes a significant transformation.
