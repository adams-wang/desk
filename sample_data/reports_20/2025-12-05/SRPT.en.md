**1. There's No Escaping Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SRPT) Muted Revenues Despite A 35% Share Price Rise**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251205T045322 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Sarepta Therapeutics' stock saw a 35% gain recently but still suffers from an 83% drop over the last year. Despite a low price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.9x compared to the industry average, the company's revenue forecast projects a 16% annual slump for the next three years, contrasting sharply with the industry's expected 126% growth. This muted revenue outlook explains the low P/S ratio and suggests potential for further stock price stagnation unless top-line growth improves substantially.
