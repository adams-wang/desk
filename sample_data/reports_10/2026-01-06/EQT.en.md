**1. Is EQT Corp. the Sleeper Energy Stock About to Explode?**
- Source: AD HOC NEWS | 20260105T054613 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- EQT Corp., the largest natural gas producer in the U.S., is gaining attention as a potential investment despite the focus on AI stocks. The article explores whether EQT is a "must-cop" for portfolios, highlighting its cash flow generation, debt reduction, and its role as a "bridge fuel" in the energy transition. Investors are advised to consider EQT's volatility, tied to natural gas prices, and its specific focus as a pure-play gas company.

**2. EQT stock slips as U.S. natural gas prices fall on warmer forecast — what traders watch next**

- EQT stock fell 0.3% as U.S. natural gas futures slid 2.6% due to a warmer mid-January weather forecast. This decline comes amidst record Lower 48 gas output and LNG feedgas flows in December, with traders closely monitoring the upcoming EIA weekly natural gas storage report on January 8th. The warmer forecast, which reduces heating degree days, directly impacts gas prices and producer margins, particularly for Appalachia-focused companies like EQT.

Wall Street analysts remain broadly constructive on EQT, seeing further upside, despite the recent cooling of momentum. The company's future performance will depend on natural gas prices, regulatory clarity, and continued cost discipline and capital allocation.
