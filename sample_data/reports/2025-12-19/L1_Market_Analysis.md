**Conflicts & Divergences**
- VIX at very low 6th percentile but put/call ratio elevated at 1.378 suggests smart money hedging despite surface calm

- Regime: NORMAL (IMPROVING)
- Confidence: MEDIUM
- Position size: 120% max
- Key action: Maintain quality positions in AI-exposed sectors while monitoring breadth for broader participation confirmation.

**Triggers**

- Downgrade: VIX spike above 20 on any negative catalyst, Breadth deterioration below 45% indicating narrow market failure

**Risk Factors**

- Elevated hedging activity despite low VIX suggests institutional caution
- Policy uncertainty with new administration transition period
