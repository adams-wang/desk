**1. Trump’s H-1B visa crackdown: Why $100,000 fee will hit TCS, Infosys - explained**
- Source: Times of India | 20251217T070947 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 92%
- US President Donald Trump's proposed $100,000 fee for H-1B visas is expected to significantly impact Indian IT giants like TCS and Infosys, potentially costing them hundreds of millions of dollars. The substantial levy aims to reduce reliance on foreign workers and could lead to a shift towards offshore recruitment and fewer visa applications. Analysts anticipate a significant reduction in visa applications and increased overseas staff deployment as companies adapt to these new regulations.

**2. Is It Too Late to Consider IBM After Its Big Hybrid Cloud and AI Driven Rally?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T023022 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- IBM has seen significant gains, up 37.8% year to date and 215.8% over five years, driven by its hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Despite this rally, traditional valuation metrics suggest IBM is not broadly undervalued, with its DCF indicating it's slightly overvalued. However, a "Fair Ratio" analysis based on P/E suggests it might still be undervalued compared to its fundamentals, presenting a nuanced picture for potential investors.
