- Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) shares fell nearly 11% after an initial push above $41, highlighting its volatility as an AI data-center optics play with significant short interest. Investors are now focused on late-February earnings and the company’s execution on 800G shipments, crucial for AI-linked data center capital spending. The company recently secured its first volume order for 800G transceivers and forecasts production capacity of 100,000 units per month by the end of 2025.

**2. AAOI stock slides 8% as Applied Optoelectronics gives back Friday rally on AI optics trade**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260105T113000 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI) shares fell approximately 8% to $36.43 after previously rallying on an "AI optics" theme. The pullback reflects investors repricing the fast-moving AI optics sector and general market volatility in optical and networking names. Despite receiving its first volume order for 800G data-center transceivers and expecting $4-8 million in fourth-quarter revenue from these shipments, the company faces risks including potential dilution from stock offerings and reliance on a few key customers.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
