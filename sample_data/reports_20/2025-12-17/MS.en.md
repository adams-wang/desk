**1. Morgan Stanley predicts 16-20% telecom tariff jump in Q1 FY27**
- Source: The Economic Times | 20251216T140838 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Morgan Stanley anticipates a 16-20% hike in 4G and 5G telecom tariffs in India between April and June 2026, a steeper and earlier increase than previously forecast. This will mark the fourth major price hike in eight years, with strong players like Airtel expected to further increase their revenue share, while Vodafone Idea's share is projected to shrink. The report suggests that telecom companies are strategically preparing customers for these higher prices by removing cheaper plans and bundling streaming services exclusively with premium tiers.

- Morgan Stanley projects that gold prices will reach $4,800 an ounce by the fourth quarter of 2026, driven by anticipated rate cuts, a weaker dollar, and strong Chinese retail demand. However, the bank expects slower gains in 2026 due to reduced purchases by central banks and exchange-traded funds. Silver is forecast to lag gold, while platinum and palladium are also expected to see price movements based on structural imbalances and demand.

- Morgan Stanley raised its price target for Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) to $102 from $100, maintaining an Equal Weight rating, citing an improved outlook for the biopharma sector in 2026. The firm believes policy concerns that previously weighed on the industry are fading, allowing focus to return to company fundamentals. Merck has seen significant growth, with shares up over 22% in six months, largely driven by its oncology drug Keytruda and strategic acquisitions like Cidara Therapeutics, which is developing a long-acting antiviral for influenza.
