- Lululemon Athletica's share price saw a 30% boost recently, but it's still down 43% over the last year. The company's P/E ratio is 14.5x, lower than many U.S. companies, potentially due to slower earnings growth compared to the broader market. Analysts project Lululemon's EPS to climb by 3.6% annually over the next three years, significantly less than the market's anticipated 11% growth.

- Activist fund Elliott Investment Management has acquired a US$1-billion stake in Lululemon Athletica Inc. and is advocating for Jane Nielsen, former COO and CFO of Ralph Lauren, to become the new CEO. This move comes after Lululemon's current CEO, Calvin McDonald, announced his departure amidst a slowdown in the U.S. business and a significant drop in stock price. Elliott's involvement aims to steer the athleisure brand back on track following criticisms of "complacency" and a loss of market "edge."

- Activist investor Elliott Management has acquired a stake exceeding US$1 billion in Lululemon and is advocating for former Ralph Lauren executive Jane Nielsen to become the new CEO. Elliott believes Nielsen's experience at revitalizing brands can address Lululemon's struggles with increased competition and a pivot away from its core business, which has led to discounting and decreased revenue in North America. Lululemon's shares rose by about 6.5% following the news, with current CEO Calvin McDonald set to step down in January 2026.
