- Alphabet's stock has surged by 60.5% year-to-date, driven largely by its new Gemini 3 AI model and a favorable antitrust ruling. While the company is now seen as an AI leader, Morningstar analysts caution that risks remain, particularly concerning the resilience of Google Search and Cloud businesses, as well as the need for clearer evidence that AI investments are translating into measurable improvements. Despite these concerns, Alphabet maintains a wide economic moat and is considered fairly valued at USD 340 per share by Morningstar.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
