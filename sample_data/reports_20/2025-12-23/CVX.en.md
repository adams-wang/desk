- Chevron (CVX) is navigating significant geopolitical risks from increasing US enforcement against Venezuelan oil shipping, which paradoxically could raise oil prices but increase operational risks for Chevron's authorized Venezuelan operations. Beyond Venezuela, Chevron's 2026 strategy focuses on disciplined capital expenditure in high-return areas like Guyana and the Permian basin, aiming for double-digit cash flow growth by 2030, supported by a strong dividend even in lower oil price scenarios. Analysts forecast an average price target of $172.42 for CVX, highlighting the balance between geopolitical volatility and its core production and shareholder return strategy.
