- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251211T215517 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- General Electric (GE) has experienced significant gains over the past three years, driven by its business restructuring into more focused aerospace and energy companies. Despite this surge, a valuation analysis indicates GE is currently overvalued by approximately 29.0% based on a Discounted Cash Flow model and marginally expensive by its Price-to-Earnings ratio.
