**1. Will CEO D Bidzos’s Ongoing Stock Sales Reshape VeriSign’s (VRSN) Long‑Term Confidence Narrative?**

- VeriSign's Executive Chairman, President, and CEO D Bidzos recently sold 9,000 company shares, contributing to a year of significant insider selling. This insider activity raises questions about its impact on VeriSign's long-term investment narrative, especially considering the company's reliance on stable domain-related cash flows and its high leverage. While the company continues capital returns through dividends and share buybacks, investors are urged to consider the combination of high debt, negative equity, and concentrated insider selling against a backdrop of slower forecast growth.
