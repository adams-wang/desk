### Key Risks

2. Valuation stretched: PEG 3.5x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Market regime shift could impact high-beta names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 3.55 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (3.8x). Institutional flow bullish (3 buying vs 7 selling).

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
