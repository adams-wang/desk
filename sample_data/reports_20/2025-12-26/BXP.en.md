- Thomas Shihadeh, Vice President/Regional Manager at Marcus & Millichap, highlights 2025 as a record year for exclusive inventory across New England, particularly in the second half, driven by attractive debt markets and strong long-term fundamentals. Looking ahead to 2026, he anticipates further inventory changes as the bid-ask spread narrows and identifies emerging trends in various real estate sectors including potential rent control in multifamily, absorption of industrial space, reset pricing in single-tenant retail, attractive risk-adjusted returns in multi-tenant retail, and a resurgence in the office market.
