3. Heavy insider selling: $24M sold (22 transactions in 90 days).

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 4 raises (avg +15%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 0.20 indicates undervaluation relative to growth. Forward P/E 94.7x attractive for 260% earnings growth. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (2.7x). Analyst sentiment positive (4 raises, avg +15%). Insider selling cluster ($23.9M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (4 buying vs 6 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 5.9% to 1.7% (-4.3% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 2.3pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 (-0.7%) diverging from MRS_20 - short-term weakness emerging. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI neutral at 56. Volume at 55% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -DUL (Resistance).

*NORMAL regime with stable risk appetite as 2026 trading begins. VIX at 14.51 (4th percentile) signals complacency while positive yield curve (+65bps) and moderate breadth (53.1%) support continuation. Focus on upcoming jobs data (Jan 9) and earnings season kickoff mid-January for directional catalysts.*
