**1. Mizuho Issues Positive Forecast for Hubbell (NYSE:HUBB) Stock Price**
- Source: MarketBeat | 20260105T140805 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Mizuho has reiterated its "outperform" rating for Hubbell and increased its price target to $500, indicating an 8% upside from the current share price. This positive forecast follows Hubbell's Q3 earnings beat and strong FY2025 guidance, which surpassed analyst expectations. While institutional investors hold a significant portion of HUBB stock, there have been mixed insider activities with both a director purchase and an insider sale reported.

**2. Is Now The Time To Look At Buying EnerSys (NYSE:ENS)?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T110916 | Neutral | Relevance: 65%
- EnerSys (NYSE:ENS) has seen a significant share price rise and is currently trading near its 52-week high, but its valuation, based on the price-to-earnings ratio of 16.5x, suggests it might still be cheap compared to the Electrical industry average of 30.52x. Despite a relatively muted profit growth forecast of 6.0% for the next year, its current trading price below the industry PE ratio could make it an attractive opportunity for both existing shareholders and potential investors, though volatility and balance sheet strength should be considered.
