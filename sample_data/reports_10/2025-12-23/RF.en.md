- Activist investor HoldCo is intensifying its efforts to block Fifth Third's $10.9 billion acquisition of Comerica, arguing the deal was rushed and driven by Comerica CEO Curt Farmer's personal interests rather than shareholder value. HoldCo points to the unusually short 17-day timeline for the deal's execution, contrasting it with other recent bank mergers, and highlights supplemental disclosures suggesting the timing aimed to neutralize a proxy contest. Despite proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommending approval due to reasonable valuation and lack of competing offers, HoldCo maintains that Farmer's significant compensation package in the merger indicates a conflict of interest.
