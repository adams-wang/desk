- Cost segregation studies can significantly boost commercial real estate (CRE) cash flow by accelerating depreciation deductions and making capital available for reinvestment. By identifying property components eligible for shorter depreciation periods, such as those covered by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), owners can realize substantial immediate tax savings. This strategy allows the reinvestment of tax savings back into properties or other projects, maximizing current deductions and helping owners unlock hidden value in their CRE portfolios.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
