- Morgan Stanley has increased its price target for ASM International NV (AS:ASMI) to EUR625.00 from EUR600.00, maintaining an "Overweight" rating. This adjustment comes after encouraging comments from Intel and KLA regarding semiconductor equipment spending for 2026, indicating an improved outlook for leading-edge logic capital expenditure.

- Discussions surrounding Micron Technology (MU) are focused on the surging demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI applications, with reports indicating Micron's 2025 HBM supply is already sold out. The company's strategic shift to exit parts of the consumer memory market and focus on high-margin AI and data center products is a key topic. Anticipation is high for Micron's Q1 2026 earnings report on December 17, with analysts like Mizuho and Wolfe Research having raised price targets.

-  TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar raised the price target for Applied Materials (AMAT) to $315 from $260, maintaining a Buy rating, due to the company's strong position in both the DRAM sector and leading-edge Foundry market uptrends. The company achieved $28.4 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2025, a 4% increase from 2024, with broad-based growth across its segments. Applied Materials expects to benefit from the AI computing boom and anticipates revenue of ~$6.85 billion for FQ1 2026.

**5. Assessing Amkor Technology’s (AMKR) Valuation After Intel’s EMIB Packaging Win and AI Growth Optimism**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251209T220901 | Neutral | Relevance: 59%
-  Amkor Technology (AMKR) has seen a significant boost from Intel's EMIB chip packaging work and broader AI-driven semiconductor demand, leading to a substantial increase in its share price. While its Price-to-Earnings ratio of 35.9x appears slightly cheap compared to semiconductor peers and aligns with an estimated fair P/E, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model suggests the stock might be overvalued at $12.71 per share versus its current price of $44.71. Investors must consider whether the current valuation fully accounts for future AI growth or if it carries a steep premium.
