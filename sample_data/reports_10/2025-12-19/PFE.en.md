- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251219T164750 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Pfizer (PFE) is considered materially undervalued with a nearly 7% forward yield, despite recent underperformance and guidance revisions.

While near-term upside is limited until growth visibility improves, the company's strong free cash flow and sustainable dividend make it an attractive income opportunity for patient investors.
