-  Morgan Stanley downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Equal Weight from Overweight, citing valuation concerns that already reflect most expected gains from its artificial intelligence initiatives. The firm set a $425 price target, noting that while Tesla remains strong, optimism around its non-auto businesses limits risk-reward. The updated valuation incorporates higher long-term assumptions for Full Self Driving and network services, but lowers auto valuation due to reduced volume estimates amid slower EV adoption and rising competition.
