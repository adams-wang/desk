- A U.S. District Judge is likely to allow millions of Ticketmaster customers to proceed with an antitrust class action lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation. The lawsuit, filed in January 2022, seeks monetary damages, alleging that the companies dominate the ticketing market and cause inflated prices. This development follows the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to enforce Live Nation's arbitration clause, which would have diverted consumer complaints away from the courts.
