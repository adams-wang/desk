- RBC Capital has reduced its price target for Southern Co. (NYSE:SO) to $99 from $107, while maintaining a Sector Perform rating due to recent regulatory outcomes and upcoming political uncertainties. The adjustment follows a $4 billion addition to Southern's capital plan related to the Georgia All-Source Request for Proposals and a subsequent reduction in 2026-2027 earnings estimates. The stock is currently trading approximately 16% below RBC's new target and its 52-week high.

**3. Georgia Power seeks $16B expansion to add 10 gigawatts to grid**
- Source: FOX 5 Atlanta | 20251211T151005 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Georgia Power is seeking approval for a $16 billion expansion to add 10 gigawatts to the state's energy grid, primarily to meet demand from data centers. The utility claims rates could decrease by 2029, but customers and advocacy groups are skeptical, especially given past rate increases. The Public Service Commission is scheduled to vote on the proposal on December 19th.

**4. Georgia Power, PSC staff strike deal for $16B expansion to power data centers**
- Source: AJC.com | 20251210T220858 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Georgia Power and the Public Service Commission (PSC) staff have reached a tentative agreement allowing the utility to add 10,000 megawatts of power supplies over five years, primarily to serve data centers, a move estimated to cost at least $16 billion. While Georgia Power pledges "downward pressure" on residential rates using data center revenue, the deal is not guaranteed to lower customer bills and faces criticism from environmental and consumer groups for its potential environmental impact and the timing of the PSC vote. The plan awaits final approval from the five PSC members, with the vote scheduled for December 19, just before new commissioners take office.

**5. Georgia Power’s data center-driven energy expansion plan faces final hearings ahead of critical vote**
- Source: WABE | 20251210T160858 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Georgia Power's request for nearly 10,000 megawatts of new energy capacity, largely due to projected data center growth, is approaching a critical vote by the Georgia Public Service Commission after final hearings. Critics, including PSC staff and environmental groups, warn that approving the full request could lead to significant bill increases for ratepayers, especially if the anticipated data center demand does not fully materialize, and are pushing for conditional approval for a smaller increase and the prioritization of cleaner energy sources. The decision is expected on December 19th and comes after a recent election saw new Democratic commissioners focused on energy affordability.
