- Source: ts2.tech | 20251202T121823 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Xcel Energy has agreed to nearly halve its requested electricity rate increase in North Dakota, resulting in an overall 10.37% rise and a 12.92% increase for residential customers, down from original requests of 19.34% and over 24% respectively. The proposed settlement still requires approval from the North Dakota Public Service Commission and includes provisions like an earnings-sharing mechanism and compromises on coal plant depreciation and a "coal adder." This adjustment means a typical residential customer could see an increase of $14-$15 per month, with regulators hoping to balance utility profits with customer protection.
