### Technicals

MRS_20 improving modestly (+0.6% over 5 days). Below STRENGTH zone by 18.5pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -13.7% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 13.4pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.20x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). MACD histogram bearish (-0.68), momentum weakening. Volume at 58% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.
