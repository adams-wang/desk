**1. Is PG&E’s culture of neglect too big to curtail? Alan Wong is going to find out.**
- Source: The Voice of San Francisco | 20260106T152331 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- San Francisco Supervisor Alan Wong is challenging PG&E's accountability following multiple power outages in his district, which severely impacted residents and small businesses. Wong has called for a public hearing to address prevention, disaster preparedness, and compensation for business losses. This move highlights ongoing concerns about PG&E's history of deferred maintenance and raises questions about potential public ownership of the city's power grid.

**2. PG&E electricity rates are down — but your bill might not be**
- Source: KRON4 | 20260107T002331 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- PG&E has announced a reduction in electricity and natural gas rates starting January 1st, but a new "Base Services Charge" could mean higher bills for some customers. While the price per kilowatt-hour is down, customers with low to medium electricity usage may see a slight increase in their overall bill due to this $24 monthly charge, which covers infrastructure, maintenance, energy programs, and call center services. Only high-usage customers might experience a cheaper bill if their energy consumption offsets the new charge.

While politicians and residents express frustration, legal experts warn that such a move would be costly, lengthy, and face significant challenges from the utility giant. The process would involve proving public necessity, paying fair market value, and financing a multi-billion dollar acquisition.

| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
