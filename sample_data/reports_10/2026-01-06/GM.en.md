- General Motors (GM) led US auto sales in 2025, selling 2.85 million units, a 5.5% increase, despite a 7% dip in Q4 sales and a 43% drop in EV deliveries during the same period. The company's market share grew to 17%, and it maintained its leadership in full-size pickups for the sixth consecutive year.

Despite a 7% dip in Q4 sales, including a 43% drop in EV deliveries, GM anticipates resilient demand into 2026 and sees strong growth in its software and services business. Analysts recommend GM as a "Strong Buy" due to its undervaluation compared to peers and positive profit growth outlook.

- General Motors finished 2025 as the leading automaker in the US, with a 6% increase in sales, reaching 2.85 million units despite a sluggish Q4. The company maintained its position as the second-largest EV maker and saw significant growth across its Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC brands, including sustained leadership in full-size pickup trucks and SUVs.

- General Motors is laying off over 1,100 workers permanently from its Factory Zero location in Hamtramck and another plant, impacting mostly hourly assembly workers, citing a "production schedule adjustment required to adapt to slower near-term EV adoption." The UAW states that Local 22 has lost about half its membership due to these cuts, which will reduce production to one shift. Union officials expressed concern for the displaced workers but hope some may find other company roles, a key focus from their recent negotiations with the Big Three automakers.
