- Source: Barchart.com | 20251210T151133 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- VICI Properties (VICI), a Las Vegas-based REIT, recently hit a new 52-week low, prompting a "Strong Sell" rating from Barchart's Technical Opinion.

Despite concerns about Las Vegas tourism and the rise of proposition betting, VICI's stable income from CPI-linked leases and commitment to paying out 75% of its AFFO for dividends make it a solid choice for income-focused investors.

Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
