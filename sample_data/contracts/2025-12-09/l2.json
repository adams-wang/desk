  "rotation_analysis": "The current rotation pattern reveals an extremely narrow market with Technology as the sole outperformer, creating a concerning divergence from the NORMAL macro regime. With 7 sectors in AVOID status and 2 in TOXIC territory, this represents significant breadth deterioration. The concentration in XLK (+1.28% MRS_20) while traditional cyclicals like Industrials (-1.48%) and Financials (-1.01%) underperform suggests investors are seeking growth quality over cyclical leverage. The defensive sectors' poor performance (XLP at -2.01%, XLU at -5.38%) indicates this isn't a flight-to-safety rotation but rather a narrow growth-focused positioning.",
  "l1_alignment": "The NEUTRAL rotation bias aligns with L1's NORMAL regime assessment, but the extreme sector concentration contradicts the AGGRESSIVE position bias. The narrow leadership pattern supports L1's breadth weakness observation (47.6%) and elevated put/call ratio (1.08), suggesting underlying caution despite surface stability.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: MID_EXPANSION (MEDIUM confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias, but sector data reveals narrow Technology leadership contradicting broad risk appetite. Breadth weakness (47.6%) and elevated put/call (1.08) support sector concentration findings.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nSignals validated: 1 TREND (XLK), 1 NEUTRAL (XLC), 7 AVOID, 2 TOXIC. No anomalies vs thresholds. Technology's +1.28% MRS_20 clearly above A zone threshold (0.5%), Utilities/Healthcare below C zone threshold (-3.5%).\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nZone distribution: A(1), E(1), D(7), C(2). Heavy concentration in D zone suggests potential reversal setup, but negative MRS_5 across D zones indicates continued weakness. Rotation direction is defensive given broad underperformance.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nL1 AGGRESSIVE vs L2 narrow leadership resolved by recognizing quality growth preference over broad cyclical exposure. News context supports AI/Technology themes driving selective outperformance while other sectors face headwinds.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nMid-expansion classification reflects Technology leadership typical of this cycle phase, but the broad sector weakness and lack of cyclical participation suggests potential late-cycle characteristics emerging. The concentration in growth sectors while both defensive and cyclical sectors struggle indicates selective risk-taking rather than broad economic optimism.\n\nKey Insight: Extreme sector concentration with Technology as the sole outperformer creates a fragile market structure that contradicts the NORMAL macro regime's typical broad participation, signaling potential late-cycle dynamics emerging despite mid-expansion classification."
