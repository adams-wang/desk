**1. Trump Urges Tractor Makers to Cut Costs as Farmers Aided**

-  President Donald Trump announced a $12 billion relief package for farmers and simultaneously pressured farm equipment manufacturers, such as Deere & Co., to lower tractor prices. Trump attributes high machinery costs to environmental restrictions, which he claims he will ease. The aid package, including one-time payments under the Farmer Bridge Assistance program, aims to counter losses from tariffs and weak markets ahead of midterm elections, and farmers have until December 19 to submit acreage data.

**2. John Deere CFO responds to Trump’s claim on costly farm gear, says tech is key to cheaper farming**

- John Deere's CFO, Josh Jepsen, has addressed former President Trump's assertion that regulations are solely responsible for high tractor prices. Jepsen argues that advanced technology, like AI weed detection and "See & Spray" systems, is the key to reducing costs and improving profitability for farmers, even more so than regulatory changes. He highlighted that these technologies, which can be retrofitted to existing equipment, help farmers save on inputs and improve yields, making them more resilient during times of margin pressure.

**4. Deere stock price target maintained at $535 by UBS on higher earnings outlook**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251209T134419 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 99%
-  UBS has maintained its Buy rating and a $535 price target for Deere (NYSE:DE) following the company's investor day, based on an unchanged investment thesis and expectations for an earnings upcycle starting in late 2026 or 2027. Despite a recent decline in revenue and a pushback on recurring services revenue targets, UBS remains positive due to Deere's higher-than-anticipated mid-cycle and peak earnings projections. This outlook supports their continued positive rating, even as analysts predict a 13% sales decline for fiscal 2026.

Upbeat earnings and positive tech momentum are offset by cautious guidance in consumer sectors, suggesting selective positioning is favored.*
