### Technicals

MRS_20 improving modestly (+1.0% over 5 days). Below STRENGTH zone by 9.4pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -5.3% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 5.5pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.03x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). Volume at 45% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +DUL (Resistance).
