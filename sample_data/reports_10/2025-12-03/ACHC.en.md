**1. Acadia Healthcare Updates PLGL Reserves Following Annual Actuarial Review, Lowers 2025 Guidance**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251202T160500 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. announced an update to its professional and general liability (PLGL) reserves after its annual actuarial review, leading to a reduction in its full-year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share guidance. The revised projections are primarily due to higher expected settlement costs for patient-related litigation, a significant increase in claim frequency, and less favorable reinsurance terms. The company anticipates a substantial increase in its net PLGL liability by the end of 2025 and provided initial guidance for 2026 PLGL expenses.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
