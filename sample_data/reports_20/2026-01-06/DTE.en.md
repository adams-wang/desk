**1. Did Birchtech’s Clean Air Settlement and Licensing Shift DTE Energy's (DTE) Investment Narrative?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260106T172955 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Birchtech Corp.'s patent settlement and licensing deals, including a 2023 resolution with DTE Energy, concluded its clean air technology lawsuits. While this specific settlement is now immaterial to DTE, the energy company is focusing on significant capital projects, particularly for data center demand, which drives its investment narrative around reliable grid upgrades and long-term service agreements. These projects, however, could be impacted by regulatory scrutiny over electricity rates in Michigan.

**2. Did Birchtech’s Clean Air Settlement and Licensing Shift DTE Energy's (DTE) Investment Narrative?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260106T170841 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Birchtech Corp.'s patent lawsuit settlement and subsequent licensing agreements, including one with DTE Energy, are channeling funds towards water purification, while DTE focuses on grid reliability and data center contracts. DTE's 2023 settlement with Birchtech is now considered immaterial compared to its significant capital plan and contracts for hyperscaler data centers. This investment narrative hinges on DTE's ability to execute upgrades and navigate regulatory scrutiny over potential rate increases in Michigan.

**3. DTE to implement credit and debit card processing fees beginning March 2nd**
- Source: WZZM13.com | 20260106T111400 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- DTE Energy will implement new credit and debit card processing fees for residential and commercial customers starting March 2nd. Residential customers will face a $2.99 fee per transaction, while commercial customers will be charged $9.99, along with payment limits of $2,000 and $5,000 respectively. DTE states that these fees cover third-party processing costs and do not benefit the company, encouraging customers to use fee-free payment methods like bank accounts, checks, or cash.

**4. Regulators approve DTE contracts for Saline Township data center**
- Source: The Manchester Mirror | 20260105T120821 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- State utility regulators have approved DTE Energy's proposal to supply power for Michigan's first hyperscale data center in Saline Township, despite public criticism. The approval includes conditions designed to protect ratepayers from subsidizing the facility. This decision paves the way for tech firms OpenAI, Oracle, and Related Digital to develop a $7 billion "Stargate" facility to train artificial intelligence models.

**5. DTE Energy to charge a credit card fee, while seeking to raise rates**
- Source: Detroit Free Press | 20260106T184909 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 97%
- DTE Energy will implement a new $2.99 credit card fee for residential customers and $9.99 for business customers starting March 2, 2026, while also pursuing rate increases for electricity and natural gas. The utility states the fee goes directly to the payment processor and not to DTE, as this practice becomes more common among merchants. Consumers can avoid the fee by using alternative payment methods like online bank payments, checks, or cash.
