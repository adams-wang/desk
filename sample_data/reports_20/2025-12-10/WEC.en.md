-  WEC Energy Group announced an increased dividend payment of $0.9525, to be paid on March 1st, resulting in a yield comparable to the industry average at 3.6%. While the company's earnings cover the dividend, the lack of free cash flow might pose a future challenge, though EPS growth is projected to make the payout ratio sustainable. WEC Energy Group has a solid track record of consistent dividend growth, increasing payments from $1.69 in 2015 to $3.81 currently.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
