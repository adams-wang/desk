### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -12.7% to -8.8% (+4.0% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 12.8pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (0.6%) - potential reversal signal. AM_20 at -7.8% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 10.8pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.81x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 46. Volume at 51% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +MTL (Rally).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
