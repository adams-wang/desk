- VICI Properties (VICI), a Las Vegas-based REIT, recently hit a new 52-week low, prompting a "Strong Sell" rating from Barchart's Technical Opinion. However, the author argues that VICI could be an attractive income investment due to its prime real estate holdings, attractive 6.5% dividend yield with eight consecutive years of increases, and historical share price behavior suggesting a floor between $25 and $26. Despite concerns about Las Vegas tourism and the rise of proposition betting, VICI's stable income from CPI-linked leases and commitment to paying out 75% of its AFFO for dividends make it a solid choice for income-focused investors.
