- CMS Energy has experienced a recent share price pullback, prompting a valuation check. While a "Most Popular Narrative" suggests the stock is 11.3% undervalued with a fair value of $78 due to increasing electricity demand, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model by Simply Wall St indicates a fair value closer to $64.40, implying slight overvaluation. Investors are left to decide whether the recent dip makes CMS Energy an undervalued opportunity or if the market has already factored in future growth.
