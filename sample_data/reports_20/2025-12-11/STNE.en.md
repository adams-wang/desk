MRS_20 strengthening from -11.5% to -5.3% (+6.2% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 9.3pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (2.5%) - potential reversal signal. AM_20 at -3.2% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 6.4pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.03x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 42. Volume at 50% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.
