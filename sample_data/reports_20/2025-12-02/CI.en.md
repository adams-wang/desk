- Source: ts2.tech | 20251202T160454 | Neutral | Relevance: 67%
- UnitedHealth Group (UNH) stock is trading around $325-326 on December 2, 2025, significantly below its 52-week high but with Wall Street maintaining a "Buy" consensus and double-digit upside potential for 2026. The article discusses a turbulent 2025 for UNH, marked by an earnings miss, regulatory scrutiny, a cyberattack, and strategic shifts like exiting Latin America, while also highlighting a Q3 beat and revised 2025 EPS guidance, positioning UNH as a high-risk, high-reward turnaround story for investors. Despite ongoing regulatory, reputational, and medical cost risks, analysts see UNH as potentially undervalued, with a long-term earnings growth target of 13-16% and a 2.7% dividend yield, making it a "battleground stock" for risk-tolerant investors.
