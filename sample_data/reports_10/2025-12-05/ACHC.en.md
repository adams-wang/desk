- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251204T052139 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- Acadia Healthcare (ACHC) has significantly cut its 2025 financial outlook, reducing adjusted EBITDA by $49 million and EPS by 41 cents, due to an unexpected surge in professional and general liability (PLGL) costs. The company now anticipates 2025 PLGL expenses to be $116 million, more than double 2024's $54 million, primarily driven by a 168% spike in claim frequency for the 2025 policy year. This revision places Acadia's adjusted earnings significantly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate and highlights ongoing investor concerns about management discipline and profitability challenges.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite persisting. Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
