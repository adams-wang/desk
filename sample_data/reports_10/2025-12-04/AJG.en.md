- Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 alongside its peer Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (WTW) over various periods. Despite being a large-cap stock in the insurance industry with a $63.6 billion market cap, AJG's stock has declined considerably from its all-time high, exacerbated by a Q3 earnings miss.

- Investor comfort with insurance-linked securities (ILS) is crucial for their growth in Asia, despite the nascent market. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is launching a new grant scheme from January 2026 to December 2028 to incentivize ILS issuances, particularly for property catastrophe bonds covering Asia-Pacific risks. While ILS has a proven track record globally, education and regulatory support are key to increasing investor adoption in Asia.
