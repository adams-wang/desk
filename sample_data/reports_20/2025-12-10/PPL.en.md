The firm believes PPL's current valuation does not fully reflect its positive attributes and potential for accelerated EPS growth from large load customers and Kentucky batteries. This adjustment follows a recent sell-off in PPL shares, although the company recently surpassed Q3 2025 analyst expectations and declared a dividend.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
