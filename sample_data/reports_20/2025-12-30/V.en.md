**1. Visa updates class B stock conversion rates following $500 million escrow deposit By Investing.com**

- Visa Inc. announced new conversion rates for its class B-1 and B-2 common stock after depositing $500 million into its U.S. litigation escrow account as part of its retrospective responsibility plan. This action, effective December 23, resulted in a decrease in conversion rates for both stock classes, effectively reducing their as-converted share counts. The change, which Visa states has a similar effect on earnings per share as repurchasing class A common stock, aligns with the company's strong financial performance and history of dividend payments.
