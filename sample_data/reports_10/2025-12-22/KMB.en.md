- Texas Permanent School Fund Corp recently reduced its stake in Kenvue Inc. by selling 72,056 shares, decreasing its total holding to 134,967 shares worth $2.83 million. This comes as Kenvue director Jeffrey C. Smith made a substantial insider purchase of 3.2 million shares, increasing his total to over 27 million shares.

- RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi has reiterated a Buy rating for General Mills (GIS) with a price target of $63.00, despite the company's shares closing lower at $48.71. This recommendation comes alongside mixed analyst sentiment, with Piper Sandler also issuing a "Buy" and UBS maintaining a "Sell" rating. General Mills reported quarterly revenue of $4.52 billion and a net profit of $1.2 billion in its latest earnings, while insider activity indicates a negative sentiment due to increased insider selling.

**4. Procter & Gamble (PG): Reassessing Valuation After Jefferies’ Upgrade and AI-Driven Efficiency Push**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251220T150826 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- Jefferies recently upgraded Procter & Gamble (PG) to Buy, highlighting its AI-driven efficiency gains and strong brand power. While the stock's 2025 return is currently negative, its five-year total shareholder return of nearly 19% indicates long-term stability. Despite a "20.6% Overvalued" narrative based on a $119.81 fair value, which contrasts with a current price of $144.46, another earnings-based valuation suggests PG is reasonably priced at 20.5 times earnings compared to a fair ratio of 22 times.
