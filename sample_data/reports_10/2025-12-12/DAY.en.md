**1. Ceridian HCM Nears Final Chapter as Public Company**

- Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. is nearing the completion of its acquisition by private equity firm Thoma Bravo for approximately $12.3 billion. Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the all-cash offer of $70 per share, leading to the company's stock trading tightly around that price. The deal is expected to close in late 2025 or early 2026, after which Ceridian will be delisted from public exchanges, though its operational focus on Human Capital Management and AI remains unchanged.
