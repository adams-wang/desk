Analysts generally offer "cautious Buy" ratings, acknowledging solid fundamentals but also macro jitters and a maturing post-pandemic recovery.

- MGM Resorts International has signed a new long-term branding agreement with MGM China Holdings Limited, effective January 1, 2026, extending through the current concession in 2032 and potentially until December 31, 2045. This agreement secures MGM China's brand usage rights and provides MGM Resorts with increased compensation, raising the monthly license fee from 1.75 percent to 3.5 percent of MGM China's adjusted consolidated net monthly revenues. The deal protects MGM China's shareholders by securing its key intangible asset and reflects MGM's significant market share gains since the pandemic.

- Source: AASTOCKS.com | 20251231T020838 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Jefferies believes that MGM CHINA's new brand licensing agreement, which aligns with its gaming concession period, will result in a 6% decrease in its 2026 adjusted EBITDA and a 10% drop in net profit. This could necessitate a review of their dividend policy if they maintain a 50% payout ratio. Despite these projections, Jefferies maintains a 'Buy' rating with a target price of $19.
