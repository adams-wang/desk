**1. Media Stocks 2025: Warner Bros. Discovery Shares Soared Over 170% Amid Netflix-Paramount Bidding War**
- Source: Variety | 20251231T120848 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- In 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery's market value dramatically increased by over 170%, reaching a $71.8 billion market capitalization, largely due to a bidding war for the company. David Ellison's Skydance Media and subsequently Netflix, spurred intense M&A activity, causing significant stock swings for WBD, Paramount Skydance, and Netflix. While Netflix ultimately made an $83 billion offer for WBD's studios and HBO Max, the M&A drama continues with Ellison launching a hostile takeover attempt backed by a personal guarantee from Larry Ellison.

**2. Netflix Stock Sinks Into The Upside Down Despite 'Stranger Things' Success**
- Source: Investor's Business Daily | 20260102T170815 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 91%
- Netflix (NFLX) stock began 2026 in decline due to the complexities surrounding its proposed $72 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) assets. The deal faces significant hurdles, including antitrust concerns and a competing acquisition bid from Paramount Skydance (PSKY). Despite Warner Bros. rejecting Paramount's "inferior" offer, Netflix's stock continues to be negatively impacted by the prolonged and contentious acquisition process.

**3. Warner Bros. Discovery Board Poised to Reject Paramount’s Latest Offer, Stay the Course With Netflix**
- Source: Variety | 20251231T110834 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 90%
- The board of Warner Bros. Discovery is expected to reject Paramount Skydance's amended takeover offer, opting to continue with their existing agreement to merge with Netflix. This decision comes despite Paramount Skydance's efforts to sweeten its all-cash bid, including an "irrevocable personal guarantee" of $40.4 billion from Larry Ellison. WBD shares have soared this year amidst the bidding war, and the board is set to formally vote next week.

**4. Why Netflix stock is up today: Warner Bros. board seen sticking with Netflix deal**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251231T124200 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 80%
- Netflix shares rose about 0.4% in midday trade as investors considered updates in its Warner Bros. deal, with Warner Bros. Discovery expected to reject Paramount Skydance’s revised hostile bid. This decision would keep Netflix’s offer in play, focusing attention on Warner's upcoming board meeting and Netflix's next earnings report in January. The transaction, if completed, would significantly reshape Netflix’s scale in film and television production and further consolidate the media industry.

**5. Netflix says Lions-Vikings Christmas day game drew average of 27.5M U.S. viewers**

The company now holds the record for the top three most-streamed NFL games in U.S. history. Snoop Dogg's Holiday Halftime Party also drew significant viewership, and overall, viewers from over 200 countries tuned in.
