- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251221T210959 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- ACADIA Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) has seen significant growth in its share price over the past year, up 61%, and is currently trading just below consensus price targets. Despite this rally, a detailed long-term cash flow analysis suggests the stock might be modestly undervalued, with a narrative fair value of $29.32 against a current price of $27.16. The valuation hinges on assumptions of durable double-digit growth and steady margins, and investors should consider potential risks like NUPLAZID’s concentration risk or setbacks in late-stage trials.
