**5. Costco Shares Slip After Retailer Declines to Announce Special Dividend**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251215T170758 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Costco's shares experienced a 2% dip after the company chose not to announce a special dividend, contrary to investor expectations set by previous periodic payouts. Despite reporting strong quarterly results and having a solid financial position with $15 billion in cash, the absence of an expected year-end distribution led to a negative market reaction. Analysts suggest that the company might have set investor expectations too high, leading to a reassessment of valuation despite a positive long-term outlook.
