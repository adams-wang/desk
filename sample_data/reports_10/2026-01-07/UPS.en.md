**1. UPS vs. FedEx: The Better Long-Term Play?**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20260107T010912 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- UPS is strategically shifting towards higher-margin healthcare and small-to-medium-sized business deliveries, reducing its reliance on lower-margin Amazon deliveries. Coupled with technology investments to boost productivity, this pivot aims to improve profitability. However, near-term risks exist due to missed earnings guidance and potential dividend payout challenges, requiring investors to tolerate short-term volatility.

**2. UPS vs. FedEx: The Better Long-Term Play?**
- Source: Finviz | 20260107T010900 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- This article compares United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) as long-term investment options, despite FedEx's recent stock outperformance. The author argues that UPS, guided by CEO Carol Tomé, is making strategic shifts towards higher-margin deliveries in healthcare and small-to-medium businesses while reducing reliance on Amazon, which should improve profitability and productivity. However, a significant caveat is UPS's history of missing guidance and the near-term risk to its earnings and dividend coverage.

- A gauge of U.S. transportation stocks is on track to set a new record, recovering from a slump last year due to global trade turmoil and a downturn in the trucking market. This rebound is driven by hopes for interest-rate cuts and accelerating economic growth in 2026, with investors rotating towards overlooked sectors like transportation. Among the top performers, C.H. Robinson Worldwide surged due to its AI-driven cost-cutting, while UPS Inc. shares fell amid tariffs and reduced business with Amazon.com Inc.

The article advises taxpayers on how to ensure proof of timely mailing for time-sensitive documents, recommending methods like manual postmarks at retail counters, Certificates of Mailing, or using certified/registered mail. It also highlights the use of designated private delivery services for proving timely submission.

**5. Ocean freight faces oversupply as Freightos sees mixed outlook for 2026**
- Source: Indian Transport & Logistics | 20260107T151056 | Neutral | Relevance: 62%
- The ocean freight market in 2025 was marked by uncertainty due to new trade wars, Red Sea diversions, and significant fleet growth leading to oversupply. Global container volumes grew despite weaker US demand as exporters diversified, but rates remained lower than in 2024. Looking towards 2026, the market expects a return to seasonality and continued diversification, but carriers will face challenges in managing capacity as Red Sea transits resume and new vessels are delivered.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
