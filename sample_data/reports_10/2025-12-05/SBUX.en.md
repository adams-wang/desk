**1. Starbucks to pay $35M to NYC workers in settlement as ongoing strike draws Mamdani and Sanders to picket line**
- Source: PBS | 20251203T050927 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
-  Starbucks will pay approximately $35 million to over 15,000 New York City employees to settle claims that the company denied them stable schedules and arbitrarily cut their hours. This settlement coincides with an ongoing strike by Starbucks' union, which garnered support from Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on the picket line. The workers are demanding improved hours and staffing, and a fair contract, as Starbucks has yet to agree to one nearly four years after the first unionization vote.

**2. Starbucks Indonesia + S.W.Smiley in new Collab**

- Starbucks Indonesia has launched a new collection in collaboration with S.W.Smiley, a young adult lifestyle brand from The Smiley Company. The collaboration features a playful "S.W.Smiley Bearista" design, aiming to spread joy, promote self-acceptance, and bring positive energy to Starbucks Indonesia stores. This initiative is designed to celebrate the end of 2025 with loyal customers.

**3. How Good Has Starbucks (SBUX) Stock Actually Been?**
- Source: Finviz | 20251204T051502 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  Starbucks stock has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the past one, three, and five years, with notable declines in price. This poor performance is attributed to lackluster fundamentals, including steep declines in net income and weak comparable sales despite some top-line growth. The "Back to Starbucks" turnaround strategy has not yet delivered the expected boost, as the author suggests the company needs more impactful changes to inspire customers.

**4. US judges leery of NLRB ruling that ex-Starbucks CEO illegally threatened union supporter**

-  A U.S. appeals court panel has expressed skepticism regarding a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruling that former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz illegally threatened a union supporter. Judges questioned whether Schultz's remarks to a barista in 2022 were coercive threats intended to discourage unionizing, noting that Schultz had explicitly promised no retaliation to workers. This case highlights ongoing tensions between the NLRB and courts, particularly concerning executives' free speech in unionization efforts, with Starbucks facing numerous ongoing complaints and appeals related to labor practices.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with stabilizing volatility and moderate risk appetite. Fed in data-dependent mode with 7 days to FOMC—soft economic data (retail -4.67% MoM, CPI 2.89% rising) offsetting labor resilience. AI infrastructure demand and capital reallocation themes dominating corporate narratives, signaling selective risk-on in growth/tech segments. Narrow breadth (52% above 50MA) and neutral put/call suggest complacency but not excess—standard late-cycle positioning amid policy uncertainty.*
