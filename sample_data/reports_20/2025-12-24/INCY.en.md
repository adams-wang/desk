### Decision

- **Verdict:** AVOID
- **Thesis:** VALUE

### Trade Setup

- **Entry:** $100.44
- **Stop Loss:** $94.28 (6.1% risk)
- **Target:** $112.76 (R:R method)
- **Risk/Reward:** 2.00:1
- **Target Reasoning:** VALUE thesis targets 2.0x risk/reward based on historical edge

### Position Sizing

- **Shares:** 194
- **Position Value:** $19,485.36
- **Portfolio %:** 19.49%
- **Risk Dollars:** $1,200.00

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
