The situation is complicated by increasing antitrust scrutiny from regulators and politicians, alongside a consumer lawsuit, leading to WBD's stock performance being driven by deal probabilities and regulatory risk rather than traditional financials. Investors are now watching WBD's formal response to Paramount's offer and the ongoing regulatory developments concerning the Netflix transaction.
