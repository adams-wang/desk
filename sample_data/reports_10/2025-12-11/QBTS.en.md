**1. Quantum Stocks Pre-Market Today, December 10, 2025: IonQ, Rigetti, D‑Wave and QUBT Brace for Another High‑Risk Session**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251210T100911 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Quantum computing stocks, including IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti Computing (RGTI), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), are showing subdued pre-market activity on December 10, 2025, despite significant insider selling warnings and bubble-like valuations. Analysts remain bullish for the long term, but massive insider selling and upcoming lock-up expirations, particularly for IonQ, raise concerns about potential selling pressure and inflated valuations heading into 2026. The market for these stocks is characterized by structural volatility, amplified by leveraged ETFs and active options trading, making them high-risk investments despite the long-term potential of quantum technology.

**2. D-Wave Quantum (QBTS): Rethinking Valuation After a 500% One-Year Share Price Surge**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251209T110956 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) has seen a dramatic share price increase of over 500% in the past year, leading to a reevaluation of its valuation. Despite this surge and analysts still seeing upside, its price-to-book ratio of 14.8x is significantly higher than the US Software industry average of 3.4x, suggesting the market is baking in substantial future growth expectations. This premium valuation implies that investors are anticipating strong commercial adoption of quantum computing to justify the current stock price, even with ongoing risks like steep losses and potential delays in market adoption.
