**1. Analysts Express Caution on Carrier Global’s Near-Term Prospects**

-  Analysts are expressing caution about Carrier Global's (CARR) near-term outlook following a subdued business update and revised guidance, which led two major financial institutions to lower their price targets. The company's fourth-quarter earnings are projected to decline due to weaker-than-anticipated sales in the U.S. Residential HVAC market. Despite previous positive quarterly results, share repurchases, and dividend increases, the stock performance has been disappointing, although the long-term analyst consensus remains positive.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
