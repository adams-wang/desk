**1. Why We're Not Concerned Yet About Amprius Technologies, Inc.'s (NYSE:AMPX) 27% Share Price Plunge**
- Source: 富途牛牛 | 20251228T180904 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Amprius Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:AMPX) has seen a 27% share price drop in the last month, yet its stock has still soared 250% over the past year. Despite a high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 18.5x compared to the industry average, the company's strong revenue growth of 234% last year and an anticipated 83% annual growth for the next three years (versus the industry's 16%) provide a rational basis for investor confidence. Therefore, despite the recent plunge, the high P/S ratio and robust future revenue forecasts suggest underlying strength.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
