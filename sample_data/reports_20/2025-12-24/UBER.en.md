- Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: UBER) closed at $81.15 on December 24, 2025, a slight increase during a low-volume, holiday-shortened trading session, ahead of the Christmas Day market closure. The primary focus for investors after the bell was the accelerating global rollout of robotaxis and Uber's strategy of partnering with AV developers.

- Uber (NYSE: UBER) is navigating a complex landscape on December 23, 2025, with increasing robotaxi momentum countered by a significant FTC lawsuit risk. The company is actively pursuing partnerships for autonomous vehicle deployment globally, including a new U.K. trial with Baidu, while simultaneously facing a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint regarding its Uber One subscription practices. This dynamic environment leads to varied analyst sentiment, with strong fundamentals acknowledged but long-term autonomy and regulatory risks creating uncertainty around future valuation.

- An investigation by The New York Times reveals that Uber's background check process, designed to quickly onboard drivers and minimize costs, has approved individuals with serious criminal convictions, including violent felonies. The company's screening criteria exclude only a narrow set of crimes like murder and sexual assault, and its look-back period for convictions in many states is limited. This has led to concerns about passenger safety despite Uber's assurances.

Analyst targets show a broad consensus for upside, despite differing views on valuation and the potential impact of autonomous driving competition.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
