- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251218T200823 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- MSCI is considering the removal of crypto treasury firms from its indexes, a move that could trigger $15 billion in forced crypto asset sales and affect 39 firms with a combined market cap of $113 billion. This decision follows pushback on its Bitcoin exposure proposal, with a final ruling expected by January 15, potentially impacting the February 2026 index review.

**4. MSCI Proposal Could Trigger $15B Crypto Sell-Off in Public Companies**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251218T080827 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- A proposed rule change by MSCI, an influential index provider, could lead to a significant sell-off of crypto-heavy public company stocks, potentially totaling $10-$15 billion. The proposal considers excluding companies that hold over 50% of their assets in digital assets from its Global Investable Market Indexes. This move could force index-tracking funds to sell these stocks, impacting firms like MicroStrategy and potentially spilling over into Bitcoin's market volatility.

**5. MSCI exclusion to cause $15B asset sales by crypto treasury firms**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251218T060820 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- If MSCI proceeds with its proposal to exclude crypto treasury companies from its equity indexes, an estimated $10 billion to $15 billion in crypto assets could be sold off. This change primarily impacts companies like Microstrategy, which holds a significant portion of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, and critics argue that this move could negatively affect crypto markets and unfairly categorize companies based on a flawed balance sheet metric. MSCI is expected to announce its final decision by January 15, with any changes taking effect in February 2026.
