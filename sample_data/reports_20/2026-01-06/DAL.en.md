- Delta Air Lines (DAL) is expected to report a year-over-year decline in earnings and lower revenues for the quarter ended December 2025. The airline is projected to post quarterly earnings of $1.55 per share and revenues of $15.45 billion.

- Delta Air Lines (DAL) is projected to report its fourth-quarter 2025 earnings on Jan. 13, with analysts expecting a year-over-year decrease in both earnings per share and revenues. Despite a history of beating Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company's Q4 performance may be negatively impacted by a prolonged government shutdown and high labor costs, although upbeat passenger volumes during the holiday season are expected to partially offset these challenges. The Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for DAL this quarter, highlighting a negative Earnings ESP.
