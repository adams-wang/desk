-  Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against SoundHound AI, Inc. and certain officers on behalf of investors who purchased securities between May 10, 2024, and March 3, 2025. The lawsuit alleges that SoundHound made misleading statements regarding its business, operations, and prospects, particularly concerning material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting and its ability to effectively account for corporate acquisitions. The complaint details how these issues led to an inability to timely file financial reports and required corrections to goodwill reported after the Amelia Acquisition, causing a drop in stock price.
