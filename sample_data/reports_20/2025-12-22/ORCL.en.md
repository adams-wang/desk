- Voya Financial Advisors Inc. significantly decreased its stake in Oracle Corporation by 60% during the third quarter, reducing its holdings to 4,207 shares valued at approximately $1.19 million. This move comes amidst insider selling totaling over $45 million in the last 90 days, though corporate insiders still own a substantial 40.9% of the company's stock. Oracle recently beat EPS expectations but fell slightly short on revenue, and despite a "Moderate Buy" consensus from analysts, the company faces mixed news regarding its involvement in the U.S. TikTok joint venture and concerns over data-center financing and leverage.

- Oracle's stock surged 7% after it announced its participation in an investor group set to manage TikTok's U.S. operations, preventing a potential ban of the app due to national security concerns. The deal, which includes Silver Lake and MGX, positions Oracle to audit TikTok's adherence to security terms and house sensitive U.S. data, offering an "interesting entry point" for investors despite recent stock volatility. This agreement comes amidst a challenging year for Oracle and concerns about its AI infrastructure spending.
