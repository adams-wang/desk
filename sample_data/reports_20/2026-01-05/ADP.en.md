- Automatic Data Processing (ADP) stock has shown quiet resilience in a cautious market, trading in a narrow range despite lagging the broader tech rebound. Institutional investors are drawn to its cash flow strength and client relationships, viewing it as a quality compounder offering stability. While Wall Street is divided between valuation concerns and confidence in its recurring revenue model, ADP's future growth hinges on consistent execution, client retention, and market conditions.

**4. Once a Market Darling, This Software-as-a-Service Stock Has Been Crushed. Time to Buy?**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20260104T200800 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ADP) shares are down 23% from their 52-week high despite continued solid growth, with revenue up 7% year over year in Q1 fiscal 2026. The stock's premium valuation is being reevaluated by investors due to softening "pays per control," a key metric indicating the number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls, which was approximately flat year over year. While ADP is expanding into broader human capital management platforms, the flat core volume trend could lead to slower earnings-per-share growth, prompting the author to remain on the sidelines unless the stock's P/E ratio drops closer to 20.
