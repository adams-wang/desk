**5. Bitcoin RSI nears three-year lows vs. gold as analyst sees bullish comeback**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251220T170926 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 84%
- Bitcoin's Relative Strength Index (RSI) against gold is nearing three-year lows, signaling a potential bullish comeback for the cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin has dropped to 20 ounces of gold, levels last seen in early 2024, analysts like Michaël van de Poppe suggest gold is becoming overvalued and Bitcoin undervalued, with a bullish divergence appearing on daily timeframes. However, some caution that breaking the 20-ounce support level previously marked the start of a bear market for Bitcoin.
