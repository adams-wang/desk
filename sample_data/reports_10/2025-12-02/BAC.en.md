- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake in Bank of America, selling nearly 465 million shares due to profit-taking and potential concerns about net interest income sensitivity to Fed rate changes. Concurrently, Buffett has invested over $4 billion into Alphabet, a company with a near-monopoly in global internet search, attracted by its strong operating segments like Google and YouTube, robust cash flow, and an attractive valuation despite the historically pricey stock market. This move signals a shift in Berkshire's investment strategy as Buffett prepares for retirement, focusing on companies with sustainable competitive advantages and strong shareholder returns.
