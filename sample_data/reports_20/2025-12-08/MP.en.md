**1. Should You Buy MP Materials Stock While It's Under $65?**
- Source: Finviz | 20251209T001008 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 99%
- MP Materials, the sole operator of a scalable rare earth mine in the U.S., is crucial to the White House's plan for a domestic supply of rare earth elements. The company is poised to begin shipping U.S.-made high-performance magnets by late 2025, with further expansion plans into 2026, including a heavy rare-earth separation facility. While facing executional risks in scaling magnet factories, MP Materials offers a potential ground-floor opportunity for investors if it continues to hit milestones and receive government support.

**2. Why MP Materials (MP) Is Up 6.9% After Defense-Backed Deals Recast It as Critical Infrastructure**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251208T080932 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
-  MP Materials has seen its stock rise after securing a significant public-private partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense and expanding its Saudi rare earth refinery joint venture. These developments position the company as a critical infrastructure provider for U.S. supply chains, especially given the DoD's 15% stake and commitment to purchase 100% of Mountain Pass output. While these deals improve revenue visibility and align with U.S. policy, they may also cap the company's upside if rare earth prices surge in open markets.

The piece concludes by framing the investment choice as a philosophical one between proven operations and future potential.
