- Credo Technology shares closed down 0.5% on Friday, January 3, 2026, despite a strong rally in semiconductor ETFs, primarily due to a Form 144 filing that can precede insider stock sales. This underperformance is significant given Credo's role in high-speed data-center connectivity and AI computing clusters, making traders sensitive to any signals of insider selling. Investors are now watching for potential follow-through selling pressure and the U.S. payrolls report next week.
