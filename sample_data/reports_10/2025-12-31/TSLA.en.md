The company's projections show an average analyst estimate of 422,850 deliveries for the fourth quarter, a 15% decrease from the previous year, and a decline in annual sales for the second consecutive year. This move is considered unusual for Tesla, which has historically kept such aggregated figures private.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
