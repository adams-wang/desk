- UBS has reiterated its "Buy" rating on Boston Scientific (BSX) with a $140 price target, despite a recent share drop. Analyst Danielle Antalffy believes the risk/reward profile is skewed to the upside, citing expectations for sustained momentum in high-growth areas and the CEO's commitment to grow divisions like Electrophysiology and the WATCHMAN device above market rates. UBS anticipates 2026 sales growth to exceed Boston Scientific's long-range target of 10-12%, primarily driven by the WATCHMAN business.
