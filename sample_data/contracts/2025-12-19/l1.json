VIX at 14.91 (6th percentile) indicates very low surface volatility, having declined sharply from 23.43 twenty days ago as policy uncertainty diminished. However, the elevated put/call ratio at 1.378 creates a key conflict - while VIX suggests complacency, institutional hedging activity remains elevated, indicating smart money caution beneath the surface calm.\n\nThe yield curve remains healthy at 63bps (10Y-3M), supporting risk appetite with no recession signals. Economic backdrop is stable with Fed funds falling to 3.88%, CPI contained at 2.74%, and unemployment steady at 4.6%.\n\nNews context is constructive with three key themes: AI infrastructure demand driving tech optimism (AMD, Intel, Seagate rallies), drug pricing reform providing healthcare clarity, and Fed pause expectations from cooling inflation. These themes are largely supportive and already reflected in the VIX decline.\n\nMarket breadth at 53.3% is moderate, consistent with selective participation rather than broad-based enthusiasm. This narrow leadership, concentrated in AI/tech names, represents the primary risk factor. The disconnect between very low VIX and elevated hedging suggests institutional caution about sustainability.\n\nNews risk adjustment is zero as current themes are supportive and already priced into the sharp volatility decline. No forward-looking risks are building that aren't reflected in current market pricing.\n\nRegime transition is IMPROVING as volatility normalization and sector rotation momentum build, but confidence is MEDIUM due to the VIX/put-call divergence and narrow breadth concerns. Key triggers include breadth expansion above 60% for upgrade or VIX spike above 20 for downgrade.",
