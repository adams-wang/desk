### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 8.6% to 4.7% (-3.8% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Currently in lower STRENGTH zone (4.0-10.0%), cross-sectional ranking at 97th percentile. MRS_5 at 1.3% confirms short-term momentum alignment. AM_20 at 4.1% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 4.8pp, stock-specific strength. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI overbought at 78, risk of mean reversion. Volume at 19% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +MUL (Resistance test).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
