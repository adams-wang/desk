The company's exceptional 43.84% return over the past year has outperformed the S&P 500, yet a 0.00% return on equity and price-to-book value suggest a complex valuation outlook.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T153026 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Welltower (WELL) has seen its share price rally significantly, up 15% in three months and 50% in the last year, prompting a reassessment of its valuation.
