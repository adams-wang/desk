**1. Why SoFi Stock Dropped13% in December**
- Source: Finviz | 20260106T085900 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) stock dropped 12% in December, despite the company's continued record-breaking customer growth and expansion into new financial products, including a stablecoin. The decline is attributed to its premium valuation and potentially falling cryptocurrency prices impacting adjacent stocks. While SoFi is performing well and is sustainably profitable, its high valuation (53 times trailing 12-month earnings) and exposure to the crypto market may have contributed to the recent stock movement.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
