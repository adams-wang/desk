- Western Digital (WDC) shares dipped 1.2% in premarket trading after a significant 16.8% jump the previous day, spurred by the "AI storage" trade following comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at CES 2026. The surge, also seen in SanDisk and Seagate Technology, was fueled by reports of rising server DRAM prices and increased demand from cloud operators for AI workloads. Investors are now looking for proof of firming prices and customer commitment to sustain the rally, as analysts warn about the vulnerability of high-flying storage names to cooling AI growth or weaker earnings.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
