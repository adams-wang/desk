### Technicals

Volume at 33% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -DBL (Indecision).

### Position Sizing

- **Shares:** 80
- **Position Value:** $13,246.40
- **Portfolio %:** 13.25%
- **Risk Dollars:** $1,380.00

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
