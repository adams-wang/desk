-  Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk has again approached the Delhi High Court, this time seeking to prevent Sun Pharmaceutical from dealing in semaglutide, the active ingredient in its blockbuster weight-loss drug Ozempic. This move follows a recent court decision allowing Dr. Reddy's Laboratories to manufacture and export its semaglutide-based drug, though it is barred from selling it in India until Novo Nordisk's patent expires. The case has been transferred to the same court handling the previous Dr. Reddy's suit for a consolidated hearing.
