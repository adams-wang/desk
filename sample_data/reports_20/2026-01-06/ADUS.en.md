- Addus HomeCare (ADUS) is experiencing revenue growth driven by strong Medicaid rate hikes and strategic acquisitions, but its stock performance has lagged due to investor caution regarding heavy M&A integration costs, negative free cash flow, and potential home health reimbursement cuts. Despite a positive Wall Street consensus and a solid balance sheet, the company faces risks from regulatory changes, persistent negative cash flow, and integration challenges, which may impact its profitability and reliance on external financing. Long-term investors who can tolerate cash flow volatility may find ADUS an attractive opportunity in the growing home care market.
