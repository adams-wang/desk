- Lamb Weston Holdings Inc. (LW) saw its stock price drop by 2.34% to $41.80 on Tuesday, despite a generally strong trading session for the broader market.

**2. Why Lamb Weston (LW) Shares Are Sliding Today**
- Source: Finviz | 20251222T210843 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Shares of Lamb Weston (LW) fell by 2.1% after BNP Paribas Exane downgraded the stock to 'Neutral' and significantly lowered its price target, citing intensifying competition. This follows a similar action by Bank of America Securities and was exacerbated by the company's recent Q2 earnings report, which, despite beating Wall Street expectations, included full-year guidance projecting flat revenue and an 11% fall in a key earnings metric, indicating a potential sacrifice of profitability for market share. These concerns, coupled with a previous 24.1% drop due to a disappointing full-year outlook, have led to a 35.1% year-to-date decline for the stock.

**3. Lamb Weston Earnings: Shares Plunge as Market Disappointed by Guidance, but Valuation Attractive**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251222T150844 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Lamb Weston's second-quarter sales were flat at $1.62 billion due to lower price/mix offsetting higher volume, and adjusted EBITDA margin fell to 17.7%. Despite this, the company maintained its full-year guidance for net sales ($6.35 billion-$6.55 billion) and adjusted EBITDA ($1 billion-$1.2 billion). The market, however, reacted negatively to the guidance, causing shares to plunge, even though the valuation is considered attractive.

**4. Lamb Weston reports Q2 2026 performance with volume growth, cost savings progress and dividend increase**
