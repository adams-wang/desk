**1. A Look At Semtech (SMTC) Valuation After Recent Share Price Weakness And Long Term Returns**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260106T030951 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 99%
- Semtech (SMTC) has experienced recent share price weakness, with a 30-day decline of 6.62% and a year-to-date decline of 1.22%, despite stronger long-term returns. The company is considered 9.3% undervalued based on a narrative fair value of US$82, driven by demand from hyperscale data centers and AI infrastructure, potentially leading to significant revenue and margin expansion. However, Simply Wall St's DCF model suggests the stock is overvalued at US$46.41, raising questions about whether growth expectations are outpacing fundamentals.
