- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T110916 | Neutral | Relevance: 62%
- EnerSys (NYSE:ENS) has seen a significant share price rise and is currently trading near its 52-week high, but its valuation, based on the price-to-earnings ratio of 16.5x, suggests it might still be cheap compared to the Electrical industry average of 30.52x. Despite a relatively muted profit growth forecast of 6.0% for the next year, its current trading price below the industry PE ratio could make it an attractive opportunity for both existing shareholders and potential investors, though volatility and balance sheet strength should be considered.
