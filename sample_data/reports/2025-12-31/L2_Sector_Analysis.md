    - Summary: FirstEnergy Corp. stock has seen sideways trading recently, presenting a dilemma for investors balancing its strong dividend yield against persistent legal and regulatory issues. While the company has shown modest positive total returns over the last year due to dividends and has received cautiously constructive ratings from Wall Street, its future hinges on successful grid modernization, regulatory approvals, and sustained governance reforms. The stock remains in a holding pattern, not collapsing nor breaking out, as the market awaits clearer signals on its long-term stability and growth trajectory.
