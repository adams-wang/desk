### Key Risks

1. High beta (1.98) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-3.0% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 5.0x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Near-term weakness: 16.5% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 3 raises (avg +9%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.96 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 113.4x stretched relative to 4% growth. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (2.7x), low leverage (D/E 0.27). Analyst sentiment positive (3 raises, avg +9%). Insider selling cluster ($1.2M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -15.7% to -18.7% (-3.0% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 22.7pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -17.1% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 18.3pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.04x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). MACD histogram bearish (-2.23), momentum weakening. Elevated volume (1.4x 20MA), institutional activity likely. OFD pattern: -MLN (Support test).

| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderately constructive conditions. Fed dovish pivot expectations from weak jobs data and declining VIX suggest improving risk appetite, though narrow breadth at 51% indicates selective participation. Focus on quality sectors benefiting from rate cut expectations.*
