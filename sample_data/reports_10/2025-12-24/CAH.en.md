**1. Cardinal Health (CAH): Evaluating Valuation After Revenue Beat and Growing Optimism in Healthcare Services**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251223T110724 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Cardinal Health (CAH) has exceeded revenue expectations, leading to a strong stock performance with a 32.71% return in 90 days and a 334.33% total shareholder return over five years. The company is currently considered modestly undervalued with a narrative fair value near $216.60 against a closing price of $205.20, driven by growth in healthcare services, though tighter drug pricing regulations could pose risks. While the narrative suggests undervaluation, a higher-than-industry P/E ratio indicates less room for error if growth slows.
