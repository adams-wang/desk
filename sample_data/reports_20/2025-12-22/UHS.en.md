**2. Tenet Healthcare (THC): Valuation Check as Policy Debates and Cigna Dispute Draw Investor Focus**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251220T060913 | Neutral | Relevance: 55%
- Tenet Healthcare (THC) is under investor scrutiny due to strong earnings and a potentially undervalued stock, despite policy debates regarding the Affordable Care Act and a Cigna contract dispute. While its current P/E ratio of 12.7x is significantly lower than industry averages, suggesting undervaluation, a discounted cash flow model indicates an even deeper value, with a fair value of around $370.12. However, these positive valuations are tempered by risks associated with potential changes to ACA subsidies and the outcome of the Cigna dispute.
