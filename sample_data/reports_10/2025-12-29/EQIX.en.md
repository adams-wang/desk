Over the past year, the data center REIT has delivered a 13-15% return for investors, driven by demand from AI, cloud, and interconnection.

While hardware companies like Nvidia have seen their shares skyrocket, this article highlights the overlooked "pick-and-shovel" plays crucial to the AI gold rush, focusing on data center developers and energy companies.

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
