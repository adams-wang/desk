- Source: TIKR.com | 20260105T120758 | Bearish | Relevance: 63%
- Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stock saw a significant 35% decline in 2025 due to a "brutal selloff" linked to decreased consumer sentiment, particularly among lower- and middle-income diners and the 25-35 age demographic. The company cut its full-year same-store sales forecast for the third consecutive quarter, leading analysts to reduce price targets and question the short-term outlook, despite acknowledging the brand's fundamental health. Chipotle is responding with increased marketing, new menu items, improved operations, and aggressive expansion plans for 2026, aiming for a return to growth.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
