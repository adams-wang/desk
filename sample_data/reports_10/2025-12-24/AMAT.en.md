**1. Will DRAM Strength Drive Applied Materials' Next Growth Phase?**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20251224T154836 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Applied Materials (AMAT) is well-positioned for growth due to improving conditions in the Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) market, particularly with leading-edge customers and the increasing demand for memory in AI applications. The company has enhanced its presence in the DRAM market, with revenues from leading-edge customers growing over 50% in the last four fiscal quarters. This trend, coupled with the rising need for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) in AI servers, is expected to make DRAM and HBM key drivers for semiconductor equipment spending in the coming years, benefiting Applied Materials.
