- Altria (NYSE: MO), known for its Marlboro cigarettes and a 7.4% dividend yield, faces significant challenges as its core tobacco business is in steady decline, with shrinking sales volumes year over year.

- Altria (NYSE: MO), known for its Marlboro cigarettes and a 7.4% dividend yield, faces significant challenges as its core cigarette business is in steady decline, with shrinking sales volumes year over year. Despite its classification as a consumer staples company with a strong brand, its reliance on a single, shrinking product and a history of strategic missteps in developing alternative nicotine products make it an unlikely path to wealth for most investors. The high dividend yield, while attractive, reflects the underlying risks and declining business trends.

### Market Context

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
