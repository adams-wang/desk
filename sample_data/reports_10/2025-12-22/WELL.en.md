He analyzes ServiceNow's potential acquisition of Armis for $7 billion, viewing it as a strategic move into cybersecurity despite reservations about the price.

**3. 2026 Could Be Explosive For The SPDR Dow Jones REIT, And It’s 4% Dividend**
- Source: 24/7 Wall St. | 20251220T161007 | Neutral | Relevance: 83%
- The SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR) holds $1.7 billion in assets and offers a roughly 4% dividend, though it has lagged the broader market with only 3% gains year-to-date. Goldman Sachs projects two more Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2026, which could significantly benefit REITs by reducing borrowing costs and making their dividends more attractive. While RWR's top holdings like Welltower show strong investor optimism, its valuation raises questions, and investors might consider the iShares Core U.S. REIT ETF (USRT) as a larger, lower-cost alternative.

Despite insider reductions, analysts maintain a "Moderate Buy" rating with a target price of $79.31, aligning with the company's current trading price, positive FY2025 EPS guidance, and a declared quarterly dividend.

**5. 2026 Looks Like An Inflection Point For Schwab’s US REIT To Launch Higher | SCHH**
- Source: 24/7 Wall St. | 20251222T135731 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 73%
- The Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH) is poised for an inflection point in 2026 as Federal Reserve rate cuts are anticipated to drive lower long-term Treasury yields, making REIT dividends more attractive and reducing discount rates for property valuations. With a significant $162 billion in commercial real estate loans maturing in 2026, the success of SCHH's holdings hinges on a favorable refinancing environment spurred by falling rates. The ETF's performance will also depend on the momentum of its various subsectors, including healthcare and industrial REITs, and the 10-year Treasury yield's movement below 4%.
