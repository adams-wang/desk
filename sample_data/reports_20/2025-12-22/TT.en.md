**1. Aramark (ARMK): Exploring Whether Steady Three‑Year Gains Still Leave Upside in the Valuation**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251221T150946 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- Aramark (ARMK) has shown steady market outperformance over three years, with a 31% total shareholder return, and sustained revenue and earnings growth. A narrative analysis suggests the stock is 14.9% undervalued, with a fair value of $44.60 due to margin expansion from tech investments. However, its current P/E ratio of 30.6x is higher than the industry average, implying the market may already be pricing in significant future growth, indicating a potential risk if earnings don't meet expectations.
