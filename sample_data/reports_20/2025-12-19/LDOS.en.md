**2. Science Applications International (SAIC): Valuation Check After Ravi Dankanikote Becomes Chief Growth Officer**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251219T010935 | Neutral | Relevance: 65%
- Science Applications International (SAIC) has appointed Ravi Dankanikote as Chief Growth Officer, raising questions about the company's valuation as its share price has risen recently despite a negative year-to-date return. Simply Wall St's analysis suggests SAIC is 11.2% undervalued, with a narrative fair value of $113.38, driven by expected operational efficiencies and resilient margins rather than substantial headline growth. However, future revenue and margin growth could be challenged by budget uncertainty and increased competition in federal IT contracts.

This collaboration follows Boeing's recent OTA agreement and aims to counter aerial threats like cruise missiles and drones, filling a critical gap between short and long-range air defense systems. The competition is intense, involving other major players like Lockheed Martin and a partnership between RTX and Rafael, all vying to provide a more cost-effective and numerous missile solution to enhance "magazine depth."

- BigBear.ai stock (NYSE: BBAI) experienced a significant slide on December 17, 2025, driven by investor concerns over an upcoming shareholder vote on share authorization, which analysts fear could lead to potential dilution. The company is also anticipating the acquisition of Ask Sage, a secure generative AI platform, which is central to its growth strategy, aiming to shift towards recurring revenue streams. Amidst this, recent Q3 2025 financials show shrinking revenue and margin pressure, creating a volatile environment where investor sentiment is divided between dilution risks and the potential for long-term growth through its defense-focused AI offerings and large backlog.
