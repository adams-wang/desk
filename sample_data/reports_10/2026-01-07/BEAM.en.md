While Beam is considered undervalued by a narrative model, analysts note its high price-to-sales ratio, suggesting the market is anticipating significant future growth, which comes with inherent risks regarding clinical outcomes and regulatory approvals.

3. High short interest (21.9%, 10.2 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_10 improving +1.6% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 7.09 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (6.0x), low leverage (D/E 0.36). Revenue growth strong at 22% YoY. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 2 selling).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
