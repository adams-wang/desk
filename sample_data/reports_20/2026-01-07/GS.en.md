The firm anticipates the MSCI China Index to rise by about 20% and the CSI 300 Index by 12% by the end of 2026, supported by factors like AI adoption, global expansion, and policy efforts.

- Goldman Sachs shares rose 0.7% after hours, reflecting its position at the top of 2025 global M&A rankings with $1.48 trillion in deals. Investors are now keenly awaiting the bank's Jan. 15 earnings release to assess the momentum for investment-banking fees in 2026, especially after 2025 delivered a strong fee pool. Barclays has also raised its price target for Goldman to $1,048 from $850, maintaining an Overweight rating.

- Hans Swildens, Justin Burden, and Roland Reynolds have joined Goldman Sachs as Partners in its Asset and Wealth Management business, specifically within the External Investing Group (XIG) of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. This move is part of the closing of the Industry Ventures acquisition, where all three previously held key leadership roles.

**5. Goldman Sachs Ruled 2025’S M&A League Tables**
- Source: Finimize | 20260106T204349 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Goldman Sachs led 2025's global M&A league tables, advising on $1.48 trillion in deals and earning about $4.6 billion in M&A fees, driven by a surge in mega-deals worth $10 billion or more. While Goldman dominated in M&A, JPMorgan still held the top spot for overall investment-banking fees. The increase in large-scale transactions suggests that companies are opting for acquisitions for growth due to favorable financing conditions, lower interest rates, and a thinner IPO pipeline.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
