-  Warner Bros CEO David Zaslav is poised to become a billionaire due to high-stakes bidding wars between Netflix and Paramount for his company, with a compensation package linked to the deal's outcome. Zaslav, known for orchestrating the Discovery-WarnerMedia merger, attributes his success to an intense work ethic, a lesson learned from a teenage tennis experience where he vowed never to be "outworked" again. He advises that hard work, not just talent, is the ultimate driver of success, a principle he embodies with a 4:45 a.m. daily start.

- Source: New York Post | 20251210T210906 | Neutral | Relevance: 74%
-  Right-wing provocateur Laura Loomer has strongly criticized Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, labeling him a "selfish leftist" for his opposition to the proposed Nexstar Media-Tegna merger. Loomer argues that Ruddy's stance against lifting the 39% ownership cap for local TV stations, which would facilitate the merger, empowers the left-wing media and harms the MAGA movement. She asserts that Nexstar, unlike Ruddy, aligns with conservative values and President Trump, and that removing the cap would enable conservative local stations to better compete.
