- Several labor unions and public interest groups, including Free Press and NABET-CWA, have petitioned the FCC to deny the Nexstar-Tegna merger, arguing it violates station ownership caps and is not in the public interest. The proposed deal would create a massive broadcasting group with 265 stations across 44 states and Washington, D.C., leading to concerns about higher prices for consumers and adverse effects on local broadcasters. Opponents like EchoStar and Circle City Broadcasting claim the merger would result in a near-monopoly, reduce local news, and harm other local outlets.

The company argues that station owners, not networks, should control the distribution of their signals to vMVPDs.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
