- This article summarizes a bullish thesis on Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), highlighting its strong position in the cardiometabolic health segment with drugs like Mounjaro and Zepbound. Despite an 18% YTD stock drop, the company presents a compelling BUY opportunity due to its leadership in addressing major health issues like obesity and Alzheimer's, strong operational profitability, and significant R&D capabilities.

- Eli Lilly stock has seen significant growth, driven by its blockbuster weight loss drug portfolio, Mounjaro and Zepbound, which dominate the market alongside Novo Nordisk. The company is preparing for a new growth driver, orforglipron, a potential oral weight loss pill, and is investing heavily in manufacturing capacity in anticipation of its 2026 approval.

- Eli Lilly's stock is trading near record highs due to the success of its obesity and diabetes drugs, particularly Zepbound and Mounjaro. Recent price cuts for Zepbound and a strong Q3 2025 earnings report have reshaped its outlook, alongside a significant push with its Alzheimer's drug Kisunla and an oral GLP-1 candidate, orforglipron.

- Eli Lilly and Company's oncology drug, Jaypirca, has received expanded FDA approval for earlier use in adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). This approval allows the drug to be prescribed immediately after a covalent BTK inhibitor, converting its previous accelerated approval into a full traditional one based on phase 3 clinical study results. Despite a slight dip in stock price amidst broader market conditions, LLY continues to demonstrate strong long-term performance, reinforcing its position in cancer drug development.
