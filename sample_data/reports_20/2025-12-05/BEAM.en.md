**1. Beam Therapeutics: Strong Buy On BEAM-101 Progress And In Vivo LNP Shots On Goal**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251204T143900 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Beam Therapeutics Inc. (BEAM) is rated a Strong Buy due to promising BEAM-101 phase 1/2 BEACON trial data for sickle cell disease and the potential of BEAM-302 for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The company's strong financial position, with a cash runway extending into 2028 and a significant stake in a recently acquired company, further supports this rating. Forthcoming ASH data in December 2025 and a pivotal readout for BEAM-302 in early 2026 are anticipated catalysts.

**2. Why Is Beam Therapeutics (BEAM) Up 15.9% Since Last Earnings Report?**

- Beam Therapeutics Inc. (BEAM) has seen its shares jump 15.9% since its last earnings report, outperforming the S&P 500.

Investors are left questioning if the recent positive stock trend can continue amidst these mixed financial signals.
