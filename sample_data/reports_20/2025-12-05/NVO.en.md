**1. Details of failed studies cast pall on Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 as Alzheimer's treatment**
- Source: Yahoo News Canada | 20251204T030800 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Two large trials of Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 drug semaglutide, sold as Rybelsus, showed no cognitive benefit for people with early Alzheimer's disease, disappointing hopes for its use as a treatment. While the drug showed some improvement in biological measures and suppressed inflammation, it did not delay cognitive decline. Experts suggest further research into semaglutide's use for amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease is unlikely.
