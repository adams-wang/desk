- Wells Fargo recently initiated coverage of Arcellx (ACLX) with an "overweight" rating, emphasizing its experimental CAR-T therapy, anito-cel, for multiple myeloma as a potential future treatment pillar. This endorsement validates anito-cel's importance and may influence investor perception, particularly given the risks associated with clinical and regulatory execution, manufacturing scale-up, and the company's profitability. The article highlights how this re-evaluates Arcellx's investment narrative, even as share prices have declined and fair value estimates vary widely among analysts.
