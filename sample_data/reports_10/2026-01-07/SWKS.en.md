**1. Options Corner: Skyworks Solutions' Plunge Presents A Quant-Driven Opportunity**
- Source: Benzinga | 20260107T210108 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) experienced a significant 12% drop, following broader negative sentiment in the semiconductor industry, despite previously deflated multiples suggesting undervaluation. Quantitative analysis suggests that the stock's recent 4-6-D (four up, six down, downward trend) sequence, paradoxically, tends to lead to positive forward 10-week returns. An aggressive options strategy involves a 60/65 bull call spread expiring on Feb. 20, 2026, targeting a 113% maximum payout if the stock rises above $65, relying on quantitative behavioral patterns despite the unusual single-session double-digit percentage drop.

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
