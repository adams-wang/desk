| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | IGNITION (Zone D) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX near 15th percentile of 52-week range signals calm conditions, while modest yield curve steepening (54bps 10Y-3M) suggests healthy growth expectations. Breadth at 52% indicates selective participation rather than broad-based momentum.*
