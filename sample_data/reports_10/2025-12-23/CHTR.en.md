- Moody's Ratings has downgraded Cable One, Inc.'s Corporate Family Rating to B1 from Ba3, changing the outlook from negative to stable. This downgrade is attributed to governance concerns related to Cable One's upcoming acquisition of the remaining equity in Mega Broadband Investments Intermediate I, which is expected to increase the company's leverage. The stability of the outlook reflects Moody's anticipation that Cable One's management strategies will stabilize high-speed data trends and reduce leverage within two years post-acquisition.
