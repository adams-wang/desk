- Enphase Energy's Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) has declined from 18% over the last five years to 9.6%, which is considered low, despite being around the semiconductor industry average. While the company is reinvesting and growing revenue, its ROCE trend suggests potential struggles in capital allocation, and the stock has dropped 84% over the past five years. Investors may need to look deeper into the company's prospects given the conflicting signals of growth versus declining returns and stock performance.

- JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC has issued $1,825,000 Auto Callable Yield Notes linked to the common stock of Enphase Energy, Inc., with JPMorgan Chase & Co. acting as guarantor. These notes offer a 13.75% per annum interest rate and can be automatically called if Enphase's stock price meets or exceeds the initial value on review dates.

- Sunrun Inc. shares fell 3.8% in afternoon trading on Wednesday, extending a pullback in rate-sensitive solar names, primarily due to rising U.S. Treasury yields. Higher borrowing costs negatively impact residential solar installers by increasing customer monthly payments and pressuring financing-heavy business models. The stock's volatility underscores how quickly sentiment can shift in the residential solar sector based on policy and interest-rate expectations.
