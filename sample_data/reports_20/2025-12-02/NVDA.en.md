- Masayoshi Son, founder of SoftBank and often called the "Warren Buffett of tech," revealed he sold his $15 billion stake in Nvidia primarily to fund investments in OpenAI, not due to concerns about Nvidia or the AI market. This sale, which included all his Nvidia shares, caused widespread panic on Wall Street, with investors interpreting it as a potential warning sign of an AI bubble about to burst. Son, however, dismisses these fears, emphasizing the necessity for cash to pursue new AI ventures, including a planned $500 billion network of data centers in the US.
