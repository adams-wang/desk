**1. |“Bullshit” — The New Way Health Giants Hide Billions**
- Source: Hunterbrook | 20260107T011354 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- |The article exposes how major healthcare conglomerates CVS, UnitedHealth, and Cigna use secretive "PBM GPOs" (Pharmacy Benefit Manager Group Purchasing Organizations) like Zinc, Emisar, and Ascent to divert billions from health plans and patients. These entities, often with minimal physical presence and staff, are depicted as fronts designed to maintain profitability while PBMs claim 100% rebate pass-through. The investigation highlights legal scrutiny, rising healthcare costs, and even links these practices to patient deaths due to unaffordable medication.

**3. “Bullshit” — The New Way Health Giants Hide Billions**
- Source: Hunterbrook | 20260106T130000 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Hunterbrook Media's investigation reveals how health giants CVS, UnitedHealth, and Cigna use secretive subsidiaries like Zinc, Emisar, and Ascent to divert billions from health plans and patients. These "PBM GPOs" appear to be shell companies, generating astronomical revenue with minimal staff while allegedly engaging in practices that drive up drug prices and, in some cases, lead to preventable deaths. Despite PBMs claiming to pass through 100% of rebates, these GPO fees are hidden, prompting lawsuits and increasing scrutiny from state attorneys general and federal regulators.

**4. Are CVS, UnitedHealth, and Cigna Concealing Billions in PBM Rebates? A Recent Report Alleges They Are**
- Source: Bitget | 20260106T081354 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- A Hunterbrook Media investigation alleges that major U.S. health insurers CVS Health Corp., UnitedHealth Group, Inc., and Cigna Group are using shell companies to obscure billions in PBM rebates. The report claims these companies established covert Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) to collect substantial "fees" from drug manufacturers, effectively diverting funds that should reduce prescription drug costs for patients. This practice allows the parent companies to retain billions while assuring clients that rebates are fully passed on.

**5. CVS, UnitedHealth, Cigna accused of diverting billions via shell firms**
- Source: Investing.com | 20260106T183907 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- An investigation by Hunterbrook alleges that CVS Health, UnitedHealth Group, and Cigna Group created secretive PBM Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) to retain billions in rebate money intended for health plans and patients. These GPOs, including Zinc (CVS), Emisar (UnitedHealth), and Ascent (Cigna), reportedly generate astronomical revenue with minimal staffing. The report claims these companies used GPOs to technically fulfill rebate pass-through promises while still keeping substantial funds, and that some health plans have already recovered tens of millions from these arrangements.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
