Metals and packaging industries are expected to see the most significant boost, with earnings growth over 30%, driven by trade protections strengthening steel prices and increasing demand for consumer goods packaging. While tariffs create headwinds for some, cost-cutting measures and anticipated interest rate cuts are also contributing factors across the broader materials sector.
