**1. MSTR Stock Today: MicroStrategy (Strategy Inc) Plunges as Bitcoin Slides, Even After $1.44B Cash Reserve – Price, News & Forecast (Dec 1, 2025)**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251201T042404 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Strategy Inc (formerly MicroStrategy) saw its stock (NASDAQ: MSTR) plunge by 11% on December 1, 2025, after Bitcoin slid and the company released a significantly lowered 2025 outlook. Despite the drop, Strategy Inc announced a new $1.44 billion USD reserve, funded by issuing common stock, to cover dividend and interest obligations without selling its substantial Bitcoin holdings. The company dramatically widened its 2025 financial outlook, projecting a net income between -$5.5 billion and +$6.3 billion, a stark contrast to earlier optimistic forecasts, highlighting the volatility tied to its Bitcoin-heavy treasury amid changing accounting standards.

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
