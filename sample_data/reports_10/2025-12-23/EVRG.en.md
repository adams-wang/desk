**1. Mizuho Says Evergy’s (EVRG) Regulatory Gains are Already Priced in**
- Source: Insider Monkey | 20251223T221628 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Mizuho analyst Anthony Crowdell downgraded Evergy, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVRG) to Neutral and lowered its price target to $76 from $86, stating that the stock already reflects its improved regulatory setup in Kansas and Missouri. Despite management guiding for 4% to 6% earnings growth, Mizuho's model assumes about 7%, leaving little room for upside as regulatory gains are seen as priced in. Evergy has still seen over 17.5% share price increase year-to-date and is attracting power-hungry tech customers, especially with data centers seeking reliable utilities in Kansas and Missouri.
