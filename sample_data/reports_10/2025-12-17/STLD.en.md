- Steel Dynamics Inc. (SDI) anticipates weaker fourth-quarter earnings compared to the previous quarter, attributing this to lower selling prices, reduced volumes, and prolonged maintenance outages at its flat-rolled steel mills. The company projects Q4 earnings per diluted share to be between $1.65 and $1.69, significantly down from Q3 but still an increase year-over-year. Despite the Q4 dip, SDI expects improved demand next year, driven by declining interest rates supporting infrastructure and onshoring.
