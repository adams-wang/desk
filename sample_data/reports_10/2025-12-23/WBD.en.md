Discovery, maintaining a $30 cash per share value but adding a personal guarantee from Larry Ellison and a $5.8 billion payment to Warner if the deal fails. While this addresses one concern Warner's board had, analysts believe it won't change the board's recommendation in favor of Netflix's offer due to other cited reasons. Ultimately, Warner shareholders will decide which offer to accept, with Morningstar maintaining its preference for the Paramount bid due to its certainty of cash and potentially fewer regulatory hurdles.
