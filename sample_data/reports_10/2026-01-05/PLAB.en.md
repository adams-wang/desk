- Photronics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLAB) has seen its share price increase by 38% in the last month and 39% over the past year. Despite this surge, its P/E ratio of 14.5x is lower than the market average, largely due to analysts forecasting an 8.0% decline in earnings over the next year. This weak outlook suggests that the P/E ratio is likely to remain low, and the share price may struggle to rise significantly in the near future.
