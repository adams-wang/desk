- Duke Energy has submitted an early site permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a potential small modular reactor development near Belews Creek Steam Station in Stokes County, North Carolina. This strategic move, while not a final decision to build, preserves optionality and aims to reduce licensing and construction risks for future advanced nuclear generation. If the project proceeds, Duke Energy plans to add 600 megawatts of advanced nuclear by 2037, with the first small modular reactor online in 2036.
