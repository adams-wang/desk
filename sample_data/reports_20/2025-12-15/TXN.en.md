- Texas Instruments (TXN) stock declined after Goldman Sachs issued a rare "double downgrade," lowering its rating to "Sell" with a reduced price target of $156 due to concerns over TI's manufacturing capacity, elevated inventory, and depreciation pressure impacting future margins and free cash flow. While the analog market is recovering, Goldman Sachs believes TI's specific strategic choices may limit its upside compared to peers, emphasizing the debate between long-term competitiveness from capital expenditures and near-term financial headwinds. The company's significant investment in U.S. manufacturing presents both a bull case for cost structure and supply assurance and a bear case regarding margin pressure during a slow demand recovery.
