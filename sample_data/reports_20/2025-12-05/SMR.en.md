**1. Is NuScale’s Authorized Share Doubling Reshaping The Investment Case For NuScale Power (SMR)?**
- Source: Sahm | 20251205T044410 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- NuScale Power Corporation has approved an amendment to double its authorized Class A common shares from 332 million to 662 million to support future equity issuance for its small modular reactor (SMR) projects. This move is crucial for funding NRC-approved SMR deployments, including agreements with the Tennessee Valley Authority and international projects like RoPower. While it reinforces NuScale's ability to raise capital, it also introduces near-term dilution risk, making secure and commercially viable deployments essential for the company's investment narrative.

**2. NuScale Power (SMR) Stock Forecast: December 2025 Rally Tests Nuclear‑AI Hype Against Dilution Risk**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251204T160908 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- NuScale Power (SMR) has seen a sharp rebound in December 2025 following a November sell-off, driven by renewed interest in nuclear power for AI data centers and new U.S. Department of Energy funding. The company faces a critical shareholder vote on December 16, 2025, to approve an increase in authorized shares, which is vital for its continued funding but also introduces significant dilution risk. Analysts are deeply divided on NuScale's future, reflecting the tension between its potential as a first-mover in small modular reactors and its pre-revenue, highly unprofitable profile.
