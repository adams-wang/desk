**1. SolarEdge (SEDG) Nosedives 9.9% as Tax Credit Deadline Looms**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251202T180844 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) experienced a significant drop of 9.88% as investors reacted to the impending expiration of clean energy tax credits on December 31, 2025. This downturn occurred despite the company's recent successful installation of its CSS-OD storage system in Germany and strong initial orders for the advanced energy storage solution. Analysts had previously anticipated a surge in clean energy sales in late 2025 as customers rushed to utilize the 30% tax credits before they expire, followed by an expected decline in earnings.
