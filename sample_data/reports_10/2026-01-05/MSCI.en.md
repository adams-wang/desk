**4. The Biggest Risk To MSTR Isn't MSCI Delisting Or Bitcoin’s Price Crashing, Says Analyst**
- Source: Stocktwits | 20260105T060830 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Jeff Dorman, CIO at Arca, states that MicroStrategy's biggest risk is its stock price failing to keep pace with Bitcoin's rise, rather than a delisting from the MSCI index or a Bitcoin price crash. He explains that if MSTR decouples from Bitcoin and trades significantly below its market net asset value (mNAV), the company's capital-raising model could be compromised, potentially forcing it to sell Bitcoin to repurchase stock. Dorman suggests that a Bitcoin crash is less of a concern, as MicroStrategy has a two-year cash runway and no covenants requiring Bitcoin sales.
