-  Deckers Outdoor has been upgraded from Sell to a cautious Hold, driven by resilient international growth and a rebound in UGG sales. While gross margins improved and HOKA's competitive position remains strong, softness in the topline and DTC channels temper optimism. Despite an attractive forward P/E, flat EPS guidance indicates a need to await Q4 results before further investment.

- Deckers Outdoor (NYSE: DECK) stock experienced a significant decline in 2025, falling over 50% due to weak consumer spending, tariff headwinds, and slowing growth.
