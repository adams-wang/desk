This new agreement, effective January 1, 2026, will run until 2032 and is subject to an annual cap, estimated at US$188 million for full-year 2026, with MGM Resorts retaining 67% and Pansy Ho Chiu King retaining the balance. The deal is meant to secure MGM China's "most important intangible asset" and provides MGM Resorts with "fair compensation" for brand use.

The fee will double from 1.75 percent to 3.5 percent of adjusted consolidated net monthly revenues, with an annual cap up to US$188 million, reflecting the parent company's increased leverage and Macau's gaming sector recovery. This long-term agreement extends until 2032, aligning with MGM China's concession, and adjusts revenue distribution to favor MGM Resorts, which will now receive 67 percent of the licensing fees.
