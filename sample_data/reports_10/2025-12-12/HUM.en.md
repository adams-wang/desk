**3. Fitch downgrades Humana ratings on margin pressure concerns**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251215T180810 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Fitch Ratings has downgraded Humana Inc.'s ratings due to persistent margin pressure and reduced Medicare Advantage quality bonus payments. The agency lowered Humana's Insurer Financial Strength ratings to 'A-' from 'A', its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating to 'BBB' from 'BBB+', and senior notes ratings to 'BBB-' from 'BBB', maintaining a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects concerns that Humana's EBITDA-based margins may not recover sufficiently for previous ratings, driven by elevated healthcare utilization and a decline in Medicare Advantage Star Ratings.

**4. Fitch downgrades Humana's credit ratings**
- Source: Reuters | 20251215T174618 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Credit rating agency Fitch has downgraded Humana's credit ratings, citing a dim outlook for the insurance giant's revenue margins recovery due to higher healthcare utilization and lower Medicare Advantage quality bonus payments.
