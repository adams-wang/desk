  "full_analysis": "## STEP 1: OBSERVE\n\n**VIX at 15.38**: Sits squarely in the normal range (15-22). At 18th percentile of 52-week range [13.47-52.33], this is toward the calmer end but not complacent. The 7.3% 5-day increase from 14.33 represents a modest uptick from very low levels - not alarming but worth noting the direction.\n\n**Yield Curve at +62bps (10Y-3M)**: Positively sloped curve is constructive. This is in the normal-to-flat zone (50-100bps), suggesting late-cycle but not recessionary. The curve has normalized from what was likely more inverted territory, supporting risk assets.\n\n**Breadth at 59.5%**: Solid participation near the upper end of the 20-day range (47.7-63.5%). Above 60% would be strong; we're just below that threshold. The +2pp 5-day improvement is encouraging. This is NOT a narrow rally.\n\n**Put/Call at 1.124**: This is elevated (>1.1 = fear territory) and has surged 26.2% over 5 days. This is the most notable divergence - options market showing more caution than VIX implies.\n\n**Economic Data**: Fed funds at 3.88% trending lower (easing cycle), CPI at 2.74% stable and approaching target, unemployment at 4.6% stable. Classic soft landing setup. No Sahm trigger.\n\n## STEP 2: CONTEXTUALIZE WITH NEWS\n\nNews flow is notably company-specific with no major macro catalysts:\n- AI theme continues (Deutsche Bank/Goldman initiating on Digital Realty)\n- Corporate financing healthy (FuboTV securing Disney loan, avoiding dilution)\n- M&A activity present (Element Solutions acquisition driving 52-week high)\n- Sector noise (energy lawsuits, utility settlements) - no systemic implications\n- Analyst upgrades (BofA on Regeneron, KeyBanc on Element Solutions)\n\nAverage sentiment +0.16 with 6 bullish vs 1 bearish articles. This is mildly constructive but nothing that should move macro positioning. No Fed commentary, no geopolitical escalation, no earnings warnings.\n\n## STEP 3: IDENTIFY CONFLICTS\n\n**Primary Conflict**: Put/call ratio at 1.12 with 26% 5-day surge WHILE VIX sits calmly at 15.38. This divergence is notable - options traders are buying protection even as implied volatility stays low. Could indicate:\n- Smart money hedging ahead of FOMC (20 days out)\n- Positioning for potential earnings season volatility\n- Simply mean-reversion from very low put/call levels\n\n**Secondary Conflict**: NYSE A/D ratio at 0.38 (weak, below 1.0) while breadth shows 59.5% above 50MA. This suggests today's action was negative but the trend remains healthy. One-day noise vs multi-day trend.\n\n**Tertiary Conflict**: IWM/SPY spread positive (small caps outperforming) while put/call elevated. Risk-on in equity rotation but hedging in options. Mixed signals.\n\n## STEP 4: SYNTHESIZE \u2192 REGIME\n\n**NORMAL** is the appropriate regime:\n- VIX in normal range (not low enough for RISK_ON, not elevated enough for RISK_OFF)\n- Yield curve constructive but not steep\n- Breadth healthy but not exceptional\n- Economic data supportive\n- No crisis indicators\n\n**Transition: STABLE**\n- No clear directional momentum\n- Conflicts suggest uncertainty but not deterioration\n- FOMC 20 days out provides stability window\n\n## STEP 5: NEWS RISK ADJUSTMENT\n\n**Adjustment: 0%**\n\nRationale: News flow is entirely company-specific with no macro implications. No Fed signals, no geopolitical escalation, no systemic risks emerging. The elevated put/call is reflected in market data, not hidden in news. VIX at 15.38 appropriately prices current uncertainty.\n\nIf anything, the AI infrastructure theme and healthy M&A/financing activity are mildly bullish, but not enough to warrant a +10% adjustment. News aligns with data - no forward-looking risk adjustment needed.",
