### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -7.9% to -5.1% (+2.8% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 9.1pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -5.6% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 5.0pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.01x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI oversold at 30, potential bounce setup. Volume at 49% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -MUL (Resistance).

- **Modifiers:** L1 120% | L2 100% | Combined 1.20x

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
