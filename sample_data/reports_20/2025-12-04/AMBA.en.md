### Key Risks

1. High beta (1.98) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-1.5% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 5.0x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Near-term weakness: 15.1% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 3 raises (avg +9%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.96 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 115.0x stretched relative to 4% growth. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (2.7x), low leverage (D/E 0.27). Analyst sentiment positive (3 raises, avg +9%). Insider selling cluster ($1.2M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).
