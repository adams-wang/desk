- Adobe Inc. (ADBE) underperformed broader tech gains on January 6, 2026, creating investor skepticism around the immediate monetization of its AI strategies despite strong Q4 2025 revenues. A "Hold" downgrade by Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (JEF) and concerns over decelerating growth and competition from AI-native startups highlight a broader shift from "AI Euphoria" to "Fundamental Scrutiny" in the software sector. The article suggests Adobe's success will depend on its ability to effectively monetize its AI offerings, particularly in the video AI space, to move past the current valuation gap.

Despite this growth, Jefferies has lowered its price target for Adobe shares from $500.00 to $400.00 due to concerns over its business model, specifically disruption risks and uncertainty regarding future monetization strategies focused on user adoption over direct revenue generation.
