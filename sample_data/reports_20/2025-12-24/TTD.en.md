- **Verdict:** AVOID
- **Thesis:** VALUE

### Trade Setup

- **Stop Loss:** $35.46 (7.0% risk)
- **Target:** $43.44 (R:R method)
- **Risk/Reward:** 2.00:1

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
