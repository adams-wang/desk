- BofA Securities has revised its forecast, now expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in December, citing factors such as a jump in September unemployment and comments from New York Fed President John Williams.

The shift is influenced by weakening private-sector hiring, labor market conditions, and the market's pricing of a rate cut, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell has not pushed back against.

- Source: Finviz | 20251201T030600 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake in Bank of America, selling nearly 465 million shares due to profit-taking and potential concerns about net interest income sensitivity to Fed rate changes. Concurrently, Buffett has invested over $4 billion into Alphabet, a company with a near-monopoly in global internet search, attracted by its strong operating segments like Google and YouTube, robust cash flow, and an attractive valuation despite the historically pricey stock market. This move signals a shift in Berkshire's investment strategy as Buffett prepares for retirement, focusing on companies with sustainable competitive advantages and strong shareholder returns.
