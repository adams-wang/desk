### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 17.4% to 8.6% (-8.8% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Currently in upper STRENGTH zone (4.0-10.0%), cross-sectional ranking at 97th percentile. MRS_5 (-0.6%) diverging from MRS_20 - short-term weakness emerging. AM_20 at 9.8% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 8.4pp, stock-specific strength. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI overbought at 78, risk of mean reversion. Volume at 22% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +FTL (Rally).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
