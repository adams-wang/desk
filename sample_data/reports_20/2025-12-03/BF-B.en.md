3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +2.1% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.73 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 17.4x stretched relative to 5% growth. Quality metrics strong (ROE 21%, margin 21%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (3.0x). Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 5 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from 2.9% to 5.0% (+2.1% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Currently in lower STRENGTH zone (4.0-10.0%), cross-sectional ranking at 86th percentile.

Below SMA200 (0.99x), long-term trend not supportive. Elevated volume (1.7x 20MA), institutional activity likely. OFD pattern: -DUH (Resistance).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderately constructive conditions. Fed dovish pivot expectations from weak jobs data and declining VIX suggest improving risk appetite, though narrow breadth at 51% indicates selective participation. Focus on quality sectors benefiting from rate cut expectations.*
