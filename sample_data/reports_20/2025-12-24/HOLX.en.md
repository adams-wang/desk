- Hologic stock (HOLX) experienced after-hours trading around $74.80 on Christmas Eve 2025, influenced by its pending acquisition by Blackstone and TPG for up to $79 per share, including a non-tradable Contingent Value Right (CVR). A key concern for investors is the reported difficulty in achieving the 2026 CVR milestone after Hologic stopped shipping specific breast biopsy needles. The CVR's value is directly tied to Breast Health revenue, making any product disruption a crucial factor for the market as it assesses the deal's overall value and closing conditions.

VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
