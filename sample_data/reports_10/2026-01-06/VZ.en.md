- Verizon (NYSE: VZ) shares closed down 0.7% at $40.23, underperforming the broader market rally, with its 69-cent quarterly dividend going ex-dividend on Jan. 12 and Q4 results due Jan. 30. The stock's "bond proxy" status and high dividend yield (6.9%) make it sensitive to interest rate expectations and risk appetite, especially as investors await key economic data like Friday’s U.S. jobs report.

- Verizon shares dipped about 1.3% in afternoon trading, falling below $40 despite a broader Wall Street rally. This dip is notable given Verizon's status as a defensive, income-oriented stock, suggesting a rotation away from dividend payers in a "risk-on" market.
