**1. American Airlines adds tough new basic economy restriction**
- Source: The Points Guy | 20251218T011115 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- American Airlines has announced a new restriction for its basic economy tickets, effective from December 17, 2025, which will prevent AAdvantage members from earning miles or Loyalty Points. This change eliminates the previous reduced earnings of 2 miles and Loyalty Points per dollar spent, making American's basic economy policy more aligned with Delta Air Lines, which also offers no loyalty earnings on its similar "Main Basic" tickets. The move is a significant blow to AAdvantage members who previously accepted basic economy restrictions for cost savings and partial loyalty benefits.
