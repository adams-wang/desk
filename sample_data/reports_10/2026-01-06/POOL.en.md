**1. A Look At Pool Corp (POOL) Valuation As Growth Slows And North American Demand Comes Into Focus**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T193238 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Pool Corp (POOL) is experiencing cooling demand due to tightening household budgets, raising questions about its growth prospects given that 95% of its revenue comes from North America. Despite recent share price softening and a 24.24% intrinsic discount to one valuation estimate, a common narrative suggests Pool is undervalued with a fair value of $322.91, driven by resilient demand, margin improvements from private label offerings, and operational efficiencies. However, subdued new pool construction and market concentration pose risks to long-term growth.

**2. What to Watch With Pool Corp. Stock in 2026**
- Source: Finviz | 20260105T130831 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Pool Corporation (NASDAQ: POOL) experienced a significant stock drop in 2025 due to slow revenue growth, and faces challenges in 2026 as consumers are feeling financially strained. The company, which primarily sells pool-related products and services, needs higher growth rates, potentially from international expansion, to justify a stock rally. However, North American sales still dominate, and improving domestic sales will be crucial despite economic headwinds.

The stock's future performance hinges on upcoming earnings reports, management guidance, and broader economic factors affecting consumer discretionary spending and interest rates.
