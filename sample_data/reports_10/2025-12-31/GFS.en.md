- Wedbush downgraded GlobalFoundries (GFS) to Neutral due to an anticipated prolonged semiconductor down cycle, driven by higher production costs for memory and OEMs reducing builds.

- Wedbush downgraded GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS) from Outperform to Neutral and lowered its price target to $40.00 from $42.00, citing an extended timeline for positive catalysts. Despite a long-term positive outlook on the company's business model, Wedbush revised its growth trajectory and near-term prospects, aligning with downward revisions in earnings expectations by six analysts. GlobalFoundries has other recent developments including a collaboration with ON Semiconductor for GaN power devices, securing €495 million in German state aid for a new facility, and a strategic partnership with Navitas Semiconductor.

**4. GlobalFoundries downgraded on longer-than-expected semiconductor industry downturn**
- Source: Proactive financial news | 20251231T150832 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 98%
- Wedbush downgraded GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ:GFS) to 'Neutral' and lowered its price target to $40 from $42, citing a more prolonged semiconductor industry downturn and weaker near-term market conditions. The downgrade suggests that while the company has a path to improved fundamentals, the timeline for key catalysts has been pushed out due to soft demand, rising input costs, and delayed government incentives. Despite immediate challenges, Wedbush maintains a constructive long-term view, expecting GlobalFoundries to deliver strong margins this quarter and see potential for higher margins with demand recovery and increased fab utilization.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
