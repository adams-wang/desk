### Key Risks

1. High beta (4.24) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (22.0%, 1.5 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
4. Near-term weakness: 11.9% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -12.7% to -10.7% (+2.0% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 14.7pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (0.2%) - potential reversal signal. AM_20 at -9.9% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 10.5pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 2.04x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). MACD histogram bearish (-0.58), momentum weakening. RSI neutral at 45. Volume at 55% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.
