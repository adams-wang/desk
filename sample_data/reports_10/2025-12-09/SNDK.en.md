- Source: Investing.com | 20251208T220910 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
-  S&P Global Ratings has upgraded Sandisk Corp.'s outlook to positive from stable, affirming its 'BB' credit rating, due to anticipated stronger cash flow generation and improving leverage. This revision is driven by expectations of significant revenue growth, fueled by strong demand and industry-wide supply shortages in NAND technology through 2026. S&P projects Sandisk's revenue to reach $10 billion in fiscal year 2026, up from $7.3 billion in 2025, with further growth and improved margins expected from new technology adoption and moderating startup costs.
