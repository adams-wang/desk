- Fortinet (FTNT) has a premium valuation, with a Price-to-Book ratio of 85.71, raising concerns despite strong third-quarter 2025 results. While the company demonstrates operational strength and growth in key cybersecurity segments, decelerating service revenue growth and conservative guidance suggest limited upside at current levels.
