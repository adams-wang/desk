- Energy Fuels Inc. has successfully qualified its dysprosium oxide with a major South Korean magnet manufacturer, holding a 99.9% purity grade. This achievement confirms Energy Fuels as the sole non-Chinese producer capable of supplying both "heavy" rare earth elements like dysprosium and neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr), crucial for electric vehicles and defense. The company's White Mesa Mill, originally a uranium facility, has shown its ability to manage the complex separation processes for rare earths, leading to significant stock growth and an initiation of "Buy" coverage by Texas Capital.

**3. Energy Fuels stock rises on guidance-beat uranium output and new contracts — what’s next for UUUU**

- Energy Fuels (UUUU) saw its stock rise after reporting 2025 uranium production and sales above guidance, exceeding 1 million pounds of U3O8 at its White Mesa Mill. The company also announced two new long-term uranium sales contracts extending from 2027 to 2032, expanding delivery visibility and maintaining exposure to the spot market. Additionally, Energy Fuels plans to diversify revenues by shifting some 2026 output focus towards heavy rare earths used in high-performance magnets.

- Energy Fuels Inc. has announced exceeding its 2025 guidance for uranium production and sales, producing over one million pounds of finished uranium and mining more than 1.6 million pounds. The company projects Q4 2025 uranium sales revenue of approximately $27.0 million and has secured new long-term sales contracts with U.S. nuclear power companies.

The firm believes the stock remains overvalued, largely due to expectations surrounding its rare earth element initiatives inflating the share price relative to its core uranium operations. Retail sentiment for UUUU stock remains bearish following the analyst's valuation concerns.
