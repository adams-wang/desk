### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.35) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-3.4% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Insider selling cluster: $4.5M in recent transactions.
4. High short interest (28.7%, 6.3 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
5. Near-term weakness: 5.2% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

| L2 Sector | IGNITION (Zone D) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
