**2. Huge Wall Street call: Morgan Stanley's new Tesla analyst downgrades stock over valuation concerns**
- Source: CNBC | 20251207T234921 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Morgan Stanley's new Tesla analyst, Andrew Percoco, has downgraded Tesla's stock to "equal weight" from "overweight" due to valuation concerns, despite raising his price target to $425. Percoco noted that Tesla shares are trading at 30 times the firm's EBITDA estimate for 2030, and he expects a "choppy trading environment" for the stock over the next year. This move positions him against the majority of Wall Street analysts who currently hold "strong buy" or "buy" ratings for Tesla.

**3. It’s all in the price: Why Morgan Stanley’s new Tesla analyst has downgraded the stock.**
- Source: MarketWatch | 20251208T100829 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Morgan Stanley's new analyst, Andrew Percoco, has downgraded Tesla stock from "overweight" to "equal-weight," despite raising the price target to $425. This downgrade is attributed to the belief that Tesla's current valuation already fully discounts its leadership in EVs, manufacturing, AI, and renewable energy. The analyst sees a "choppy environment" ahead for the stock, despite its recent rally.

**4. Tesla Downgraded by Morgan Stanley on Valuation Concerns**
- Source: TradingView | 20251208T150903 | Neutral | Relevance: 95%
-  Morgan Stanley downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Equal Weight from Overweight, citing valuation concerns that already reflect most expected gains from its artificial intelligence initiatives. The firm set a $425 price target, noting that while Tesla remains strong, optimism around its non-auto businesses limits risk-reward. The updated valuation incorporates higher long-term assumptions for Full Self Driving and network services, but lowers auto valuation due to reduced volume estimates amid slower EV adoption and rising competition.

- Source: Sherwood News | 20251208T140847 | Neutral | Relevance: 94%
-  Morgan Stanley has downgraded electric vehicle makers Rivian, Lucid, and Tesla due to a tougher EV market. Analyst Andrew Percoco cited slowing adoption and the end of the EV tax credit as headwinds for Rivian, potential investor dilution for Lucid, and high AI expectations for Tesla. Rivian and Lucid received "underweight" ratings, while Tesla was downgraded to "equalweight."
