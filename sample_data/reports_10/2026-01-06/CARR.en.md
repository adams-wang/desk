**1. Should Carrier’s DOE-Verified Cold-Climate Rooftop Heat Pump Trials Prompt Action From Carrier Global (CARR) Investors?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T073458 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Carrier Global (CARR) has begun commercial field trials for its 10–14-ton rooftop heat pump after successful DOE-verified lab tests of its cold-climate performance. This development, along with ongoing testing of a 15-ton unit, solidifies Carrier's focus on energy-efficient solutions, despite the company's modest revenue growth and premium valuation. Investors should consider how these innovations support long-term growth and capital return strategies.

**2. Carrier Global (CARR): UBS Maintains Rating, Lowers Price Target**
- Source: GuruFocus | 20260105T190756 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- UBS analyst Amit Mehrotra has maintained a 'Buy' rating on Carrier Global (CARR) but lowered the price target from $73.00 to $70.00, a decrease of 4.11%. This adjustment aligns with a pattern of recent price target reductions from other firms like Barclays, RBC Capital, Wells Fargo, and JP Morgan, while their ratings on the stock were largely maintained. These ongoing adjustments provide insight into the evolving sentiment and expectations for Carrier Global's market performance.

**4. Data-Center Cooling Stocks Sink After Nvidia CEO’s CES Talk**
- Source: Yahoo | 20260106T191808 | Bearish | Relevance: 74%
- Shares of data-center cooling system manufacturers plummeted after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggested that next-generation Rubin chips might not require traditional water chillers, raising concerns about future demand. Companies like Johnson Controls and Modine saw significant drops, although some analysts believe the selloff is "overdone" given the companies' relationships with chipmakers and their capacity for evolving technology. Conversely, data-storage stocks, such as Sandisk Corp., surged following Huang's emphasis on the need for memory and storage in AI.

**5. Nvidia’s Cooling Claim Sent HVAC Stocks Sliding**
- Source: Finimize | 20260106T170811 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 72%
- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement at CES that next-generation AI chips could drastically reduce data center cooling needs, possibly eliminating water chillers, caused a dip in HVAC stocks like Johnson Controls, Trane, and Carrier. This highlights the sensitivity of the "picks and shovels" trade to architectural shifts in AI infrastructure, favoring companies like Vertiv and nVent with more exposure to precision or liquid cooling. The market reaction indicates a new focus on efficiency in AI infrastructure, moving from rapid capacity buildout to more compute per watt and advanced cooling solutions.
