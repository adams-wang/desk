It highlights OCC's role as a behind-the-scenes player providing essential fiber and connectivity gear, contrasting its smaller market presence with its potential for significant upside due to its under-the-radar valuation and structural demand for its products. The article advises that OCC is a speculative "cop" for risk-tolerant investors looking for small-cap growth, rather than a "drop" for those seeking stable or mega-cap investments.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
