- Stifel has increased its price target for Acadia Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ACAD) to $25.00 from $24.00, maintaining a Hold rating despite the company's strong year-to-date performance and recent intellectual property victory for Nuplazid. The firm indicates that Acadia's future stock performance largely depends on renewed growth from its Daybue product or positive Phase 2 data for ACP-204 in Alzheimer’s disease psychosis, expected in mid-2026. InvestingPro analysis suggests the stock is currently undervalued, with a PEG ratio of 0.18.
