## Sector Analysis

### Executive Summary
Cycle phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (HIGH confidence). Rotation bias: OFFENSIVE. Key insight: Market is in textbook early expansion rotation with only 2 of 11 sectors showing bullish signals, indicating highly selective leadership rather than broad-based strength - focus on Industrials ignition and Communication Services trend continuation while avoiding the 6 sectors in deterioration.

### Market Narrative
- Industrials: Infrastructure spending, manufacturing recovery, capital investment cycle.
- Communication Services: Streaming growth, digital advertising rebound, 5G deployment acceleration.
- Weakness in Energy, Real Estate, Consumer Defensive: Oil price volatility, OPEC+ production decisions, renewable energy transition; Interest rate sensitivity, commercial real estate challenges, residential market cooling.

### Rotation Summary
Market showing classic early expansion rotation with cyclical sectors (Industrials, Communication Services) leading while defensive sectors lag significantly. The concentration of 6 sectors in AVOID/TOXIC territory indicates strong directional bias rather than broad-based strength. Industrials' ignition signal suggests infrastructure and manufacturing themes gaining traction, while Communication Services maintains established uptrend. Technology remains neutral despite AI narratives, suggesting selectivity within growth sectors. The severe underperformance of Utilities (-4.73% MRS_20) and broad defensive weakness confirms risk-on environment with investors rotating away from safety toward growth.
