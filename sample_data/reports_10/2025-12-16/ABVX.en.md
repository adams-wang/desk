Despite a widening net loss driven by trial costs, the company plans regulatory approval filings in 2026 and is the subject of takeover rumors, with Eli Lilly identified as a potential suitor. Abivax is also exploring market expansion and further trials for Crohn's disease, fueled by recent financing that secures operations until late 2027.

- Abivax SA reported a significant net loss of €254.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to €136.9 million in the prior year, primarily due to increased R&D spending on its lead drug obefazimod and substantial financial losses. Despite the losses, the company is progressing with obefazimod, which showed positive Phase 3 induction results in ulcerative colitis and is advancing in Crohn's disease trials. Abivax anticipates its existing cash and cash equivalents will fund operations into Q4 2027, assuming positive Phase 3 maintenance trial results and planned NDA submission for ulcerative colitis.
