The company faces a significant annual meeting on January 15, 2026, where shareholders will vote on increasing authorized common shares from 500 million to 50 billion, a move that could provide strategic flexibility for future capital raises and crypto acquisitions but also raises dilution concerns. Investors should monitor ETH price movements over the weekend and carefully consider the implications of the upcoming shareholder vote and the company's plans to transition to an ETH yield-generating strategy through its MAVAN staking infrastructure in 2026.
