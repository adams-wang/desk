### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.22) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 7.0x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (22.8%, 8.2 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 7.04 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (6.0x), low leverage (D/E 0.36). Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 2 selling).

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
