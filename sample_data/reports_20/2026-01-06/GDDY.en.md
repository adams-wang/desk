**1. Why Chipotle Mexican Grill Stock Fell 35% In 2025**
- Source: TIKR.com | 20260105T120758 | Bearish | Relevance: 61%
- Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stock saw a significant 35% decline in 2025 due to a "brutal selloff" linked to decreased consumer sentiment, particularly among lower- and middle-income diners and the 25-35 age demographic. The company cut its full-year same-store sales forecast for the third consecutive quarter, leading analysts to reduce price targets and question the short-term outlook, despite acknowledging the brand's fundamental health. Chipotle is responding with increased marketing, new menu items, improved operations, and aggressive expansion plans for 2026, aiming for a return to growth.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | RISK_ON (MEDIUM) | 1.10x |

*RISK_ON regime with strong participation and low volatility. VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) with breadth at 63.5% signals healthy risk appetite. Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
