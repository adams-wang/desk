- AAON, Inc. recently expanded its revolving credit facility from US$500 million to US$600 million, providing additional capital for working needs, capital projects, and growth initiatives, especially in data center cooling and high-efficiency HVAC. This move supports long-term growth but does not alleviate near-term risks related to ERP execution and potential margin pressure. The company continues its quarterly dividend, balancing shareholder returns with strategic investments.
