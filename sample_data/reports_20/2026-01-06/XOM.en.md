**1. Exxon Mobil (XOM) stock slips after Venezuela-fueled rally as investors weigh oil supply risks**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260106T111000 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Exxon Mobil (XOM) shares fell 1.4% to $123.63, retreating from a previous surge, as investors reassess the potential impact of Washington's Venezuela policy on oil supply and Big Oil's returns amidst an expected oil market surplus in 2026. The pullback occurred as the market shifted focus from potential "new barrels" from Venezuela to broader concerns about increased supply, keeping crude prices near $60. Investors are now watching for details from Washington's meetings with oil executives and Exxon's upcoming 4Q25 earnings considerations SEC filing for further guidance.

**2. Portnoy Law Firm Announces Class Action on Behalf of Exxon Mobil Corporation Investors**

- The Portnoy Law Firm has announced a class action lawsuit against Exxon Mobil Corporation on behalf of investors who purchased securities between February 24, 2016, and October 28, 2016. Investors are encouraged to contact the firm to discuss their legal rights, alleging that Exxon made material misrepresentations and omissions during the specified Class Period. The firm is seeking to recover losses for aggrieved investors.

**3. Why Exxon Mobil stock is up today: Venezuela shock lifts XOM as oil prices firm**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260105T180152 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Exxon Mobil shares rose 2% after Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's capture, as analysts believe this could significantly improve Exxon's chances of recovering arbitration damages from assets seized in 2007. The move is significant because Venezuela holds 17% of global oil reserves, and changes in U.S. sanctions could affect oil supply and prices, benefiting oil producers like Exxon. However, the path to recovering assets and the impact on oil prices remain uncertain, with some analysts forecasting a softer crude baseline for 2026 despite the recent events.

**4. Exxon Mobil stock (XOM) in focus as U.S. presses oil majors on Venezuela ahead of Monday open**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260105T000856 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- U.S. officials are urging American oil executives, including Exxon Mobil, to re-engage in Venezuela with significant capital to recover expropriated assets. This comes as crude markets reopen with Venezuela back in focus after the capture of President Nicolas Maduro and maintained U.S. embargo, raising volatility for oil stocks like XOM despite ample global supply. The situation presents both a strategic opportunity and a risk for Exxon as it could lead to increased supply if Venezuela stabilizes, potentially pressuring crude prices.

**5. Exxon stock today: Venezuela shake-up and OPEC+ decision put XOM in focus for Monday**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260104T170900 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) shares are expected to be in focus as U.S. markets reopen, driven by potential U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil infrastructure after political changes, and OPEC+'s decision to keep output policy unchanged. While Venezuela's oil revival would take significant time and investment, immediate attention is on XOM's upcoming "4Q25 Earnings Considerations" 8-K filing and its impact on crude and natural gas prices, as well as refining and chemical margins. Geopolitical developments and upcoming macro data on U.S. employment and CPI will also influence energy shares.
