- Multiple Addus HomeCare Corporation (NASDAQ:ADUS) insiders have offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year, which could be a red flag for investors. While insider selling doesn't always indicate a negative outlook, the significant sale by an advisor below the current share price suggests they were content with a lower valuation. Despite this, insiders still own a respectable 2.6% of the company, indicating some alignment with shareholders.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite persisting. Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
