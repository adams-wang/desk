**1. Masco (NYSE:MAS) shareholders have earned a 9.9% CAGR over the last three years**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260106T173817 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Masco Corporation (NYSE:MAS) shareholders have seen a 26% share price increase over the last three years, which translates to a 9.9% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), but this underperforms the overall market return. While the share price has decreased by 11% in the last twelve months, the total shareholder return (TSR), which includes dividends, for the last three years is a more robust 33%. The company's EPS growth of 2.7% per year over the same period suggests that the market's opinion of Masco has improved.

**2. Masco (MAS): Buy, Sell, or Hold Post Q3 Earnings?**
- Source: Finviz | 20260105T230600 | Bearish | Relevance: 95%
- Masco (MAS) has underperformed the S&P 500, with a 1.9% loss against the S&P 500’s 10.1% gain over the last six months. Analysts express low confidence in Masco due to declining organic revenue, slim projected revenue growth, and decreasing return on invested capital (ROIC). Despite a fair valuation at 15.7x forward P/E, the stock's limited upside and potential downside lead experts to suggest exploring other investment opportunities.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
