(NYSE:LII) insiders have sold a significant stake in the company, with one director selling US$15m worth of shares at a price well above the current market price. While this specific sale isn't strongly bearish, there have been additional insider sales, including the Chairman of the Board disposing of US$295k worth of shares recently, with no insider purchases recorded. Despite high insider ownership of 2.2% (US$379m), the consistent selling activity suggests caution for investors, though the company remains profitable and growing.
