**1. Warner Discovery Stock Is at a Crossroads. Why Paramount May Beat Netflix in the Bidding War.**
- Source: Barron's | 20251210T100451 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Investor Mario Gabelli hinted Tuesday that his clients would offer their Warner Bros. Discovery shares to Paramount Skydance. Warner Bros. Discovery's stock has been rising as investors speculate on whether Netflix or Paramount Skydance will win the bidding war for the media company. This suggests a potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount Skydance.

**2. Paramount and Warner Bros.: Hostile Bid Is Probably Superior to Netflix’s, but Not Clearly**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251208T200926 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 97%
-  Paramount's hostile bid of $30 per share for Warner Bros. Discovery is seen as potentially superior to Netflix's $27.75 cash and stock offer, primarily due to the certainty of the cash component and lower anticipated international regulatory scrutiny. While both bids value Warner above its independent worth and could lead to a bidding war, the author believes a Paramount acquisition offers better benefits for its shareholders than a Netflix acquisition. Morningstar maintains a $77 fair value estimate for Netflix and a $20 fair value estimate for Paramount, with plans to raise Warner's fair value to $28 if an acquisition occurs by early 2027.

-  Netflix (NFLX) stock is currently experiencing volatility due to its proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), facing a competing bid from Paramount Skydance and a new consumer class-action lawsuit. Despite these challenges and concerns about increased debt, Netflix's core business remains strong with growing subscribers, revenue, and free cash flow, along with promising growth from its ad-supported tier and expansion into live sports. Wall Street analysts largely maintain a positive outlook, although some express caution regarding the deal's risks and its potential impact on Netflix's balance sheet.

- Source: ts2.tech | 20251209T230945 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 94%
- Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) experienced an 11% stock price drop since the beginning of December following its plan to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. The proposed $72 billion to $83 billion deal faces significant headwinds, including a hostile competing bid from Paramount Skydance, an antitrust lawsuit, and concerns about increased debt, leading to several Wall Street downgrades. However, Needham maintains a "Buy" rating, and the overall analyst consensus remains "Moderate Buy" with a potential 35-40% upside, highlighting strong fundamentals but rising execution risk.

Ellison aimed to alleviate concerns about Paramount's financing, leading some WBD shareholders to view Paramount's proposal favorably due to its potential for simpler regulatory clearance. The bidding war has driven WBD's stock up significantly, while both Paramount and Netflix consider sweetening their offers.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
