**2. Addus HomeCare Is Buying Growth, But Cash Flow Is Still Tight**
- Source: Finimize | 20260105T140907 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Addus HomeCare (ADUS) is experiencing revenue growth driven by strong Medicaid rate hikes and strategic acquisitions, but its stock performance has lagged due to investor caution regarding heavy M&A integration costs, negative free cash flow, and potential home health reimbursement cuts. Despite a positive Wall Street consensus and a solid balance sheet, the company faces risks from regulatory changes, persistent negative cash flow, and integration challenges, which may impact its profitability and reliance on external financing. Long-term investors who can tolerate cash flow volatility may find ADUS an attractive opportunity in the growing home care market.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
