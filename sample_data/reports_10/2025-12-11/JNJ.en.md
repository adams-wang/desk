-  Johnson & Johnson presented positive Phase 3 MajesTEC-3 trial data for its Tecvayli-Darzalex combination in multiple myeloma patients, showing an 83% reduction in progression or death risk. This regimen, which significantly improved overall survival, could be a strong alternative to CAR T-cell therapies like J&J’s own Carvykti, especially for patients who cannot access CAR-T in community settings. The data suggests potential competition for existing CAR-T treatments and highlights J&J's efforts to expand Tecvayli's role in earlier lines of therapy.

- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has seen significant momentum, with its stock up 14% in 3 months and nearly 40% year-to-date, prompting questions about its valuation. While the stock trades just below analyst targets, it still shows a substantial intrinsic value gap, suggesting it may be undervalued. However, ongoing talc litigation and revenue pressures from key exclusivity losses pose risks to sustained multiple expansion.

- Source: ts2.tech | 20251210T180758 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 99%
-  Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) stock is trading near record highs, driven by strong growth in oncology and immunology, especially new data on its multiple myeloma treatments Tecvayli and Carvykti, and the potential blockbuster drug icotrokinra. However, the company faces significant challenges from ongoing talc litigation, with over 90,000 lawsuits and no global settlement in sight. Analysts have a "Moderate Buy" consensus, with price targets close to current trading levels, while some valuation models suggest the stock is still undervalued despite its 2025 rally.
