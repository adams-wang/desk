### Key Risks

1. High beta (1.98) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-1.7% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 5.0x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Near-term weakness: 13.9% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 3 raises (avg +9%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.96 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 114.0x stretched relative to 4% growth. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (2.7x), low leverage (D/E 0.27). Analyst sentiment positive (3 raises, avg +9%). Insider selling cluster ($1.2M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -5.6% to -7.3% (-1.7% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 11.3pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis).

Volume at 51% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -MTL (Decline).
