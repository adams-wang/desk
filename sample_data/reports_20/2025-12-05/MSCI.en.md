- Strive Asset Management, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is challenging MSCI's proposal to exclude companies with over 50% of their assets in Bitcoin from major equity benchmarks. Strive argues that differing accounting standards for Bitcoin globally could lead to inconsistent results and that this move deviates from index neutrality. They urge MSCI to reconsider, suggesting the use of optional "ex-digital-asset treasury" index variants instead of redefining eligibility for broad market benchmarks.

- MSCI is set to exclude firms with over 50% of assets in digital tokens starting January 15, potentially leading to MicroStrategy's removal from major indices and significant passive outflows.
