These strategic moves allowed the company to pay down debt, streamline its portfolio, and attract renewed investor confidence, leading to a significant turnaround in its financial performance and stock price. CEO Bryan Hanson's focus on efficiency and a decentralized structure has positioned the company for positive momentum in 2026.
