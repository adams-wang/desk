-  Fitch Ratings has affirmed Archer Daniels Midland Company's (ADM) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A', with a Negative Outlook. This reflects ADM's strong business profile but also acknowledges elevated readily marketable inventories (RMI)-adjusted EBITDA leverage of 1.8x projected for 2025, due to softer EBITDA in a challenging market. Fitch anticipates ADM will reduce leverage toward mid-1x by 2026, supported by EBITDA growth and efficiency initiatives, but warned that failure to improve EBITDA and reduce leverage could lead to a negative rating action.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
