- Source: Benzinga | 20251203T045316 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 74%
- Veteran London stockbroker Alasdair Macleod believes that structural silver shortages are intensifying globally, leading to a potential market breaking point. He suggests that the COMEX blackout reflects deeper issues, as physical silver is being withdrawn from the market, especially by China which is reportedly banning silver exports. Macleod also cautions against silver ETFs, viewing them as derivatives rather than true physical metal, and foresees massive buying pressure as the market transitions from paper assets.

- Odds for a Federal Reserve rate cut increased after November's ADP private payroll data showed an unexpected contraction of 32,000 jobs, falling short of expectations. This prompted investors to price in a higher probability of a 25 basis-point cut at the December FOMC meeting, despite the ISM services PMI showing continued resilience in the US services sector.
