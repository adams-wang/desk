**1. Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s (NYSE:DAL) Price Is Right But Growth Is Lacking**
- Source: 富途牛牛 | 20251206T151037 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
-  Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE:DAL) has an attractive P/E ratio of 9.4x compared to the broader market, suggesting it might be an appealing investment. However, its low P/E is attributed to its recent poor earnings performance, with a decline of 1.6% last year, and a forecast growth of only 4.0% per year for the next three years, significantly trailing the market's 11% forecast. This indicates that investors are not expecting significant future improvements, which will likely keep the share price subdued.
