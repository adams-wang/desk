**1. Cable One ratings downgraded by Moody’s amid acquisition plans**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251222T230843 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 61%
- Moody's Ratings has downgraded Cable One, Inc.'s Corporate Family Rating to B1 from Ba3, changing the outlook from negative to stable. This downgrade is attributed to governance concerns related to Cable One's upcoming acquisition of the remaining equity in Mega Broadband Investments Intermediate I, which is expected to increase the company's leverage. The stability of the outlook reflects Moody's anticipation that Cable One's management strategies will stabilize high-speed data trends and reduce leverage within two years post-acquisition.

- TELUS Corporation (TU) offers a defensive investment with a high dividend yield (9%+) and growth potential from its health and AI-driven digital services. Despite a robust balance sheet and network leadership, the company faces significant risks including high capital expenditure, regulatory pressures, and concerns over dividend sustainability due to a payout ratio above 200%. Long-term, income-focused investors may find TELUS attractive for its steady cash flow and exposure to secular growth areas, while those seeking rapid capital appreciation might find it less compelling.
