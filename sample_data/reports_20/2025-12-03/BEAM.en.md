### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +5.1% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

PEG ratio 7.09 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (6.0x), low leverage (D/E 0.36). Revenue growth strong at 22% YoY. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 2 selling).
