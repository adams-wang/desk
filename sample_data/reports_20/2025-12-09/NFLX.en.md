-  Moody's Ratings has affirmed Netflix's A3 senior unsecured notes ratings and Prime-2 short-term commercial paper program rating, but changed the outlook from positive to stable. This follows Netflix's agreement to acquire Warner Bros. from Warner Bros. Discovery, a deal valued at $72 billion in equity and $82.7 billion in enterprise value, which involves a substantial increase in Netflix's debt. Moody's expects Netflix to reduce its leverage to around 2.5x within two years of the acquisition's closing, which is anticipated in 2027.

- Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) experienced an 11% stock price drop since the beginning of December following its plan to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. The proposed $72 billion to $83 billion deal faces significant headwinds, including a hostile competing bid from Paramount Skydance, an antitrust lawsuit, and concerns about increased debt, leading to several Wall Street downgrades. However, Needham maintains a "Buy" rating, and the overall analyst consensus remains "Moderate Buy" with a potential 35-40% upside, highlighting strong fundamentals but rising execution risk.

This comes after Netflix reported strong EPS results despite a slight revenue miss, though insider selling activity was notable in the last quarter. Other analysts have offered varied ratings, resulting in a consensus "Moderate Buy" for the stock.

Discovery's film studio and streaming services. Analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak cited approval risk, a lengthy closing timeframe, and potential bidding war as headwinds. He also noted that the deal suggests Netflix's concern over declining subscriber engagement and the impact of short-form entertainment, leading to reduced subscriber and revenue forecasts.
