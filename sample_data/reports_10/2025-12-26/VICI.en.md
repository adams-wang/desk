**1. VICI: Future Returns Will Hinge On Caesars Regional Lease Resilience**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251226T181644 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Analysts have slightly reduced VICI Properties' price target due to concerns over higher discounting, limited new gaming investment, and potential rent pressure on key regional leases, despite stable revenue and margins. While some analysts remain bullish on VICI's long-term potential in the net lease REIT space due to its asset base and contractual escalators, bearish views highlight risks from flat regional gaming growth potentially impacting the Caesars regional lease. The company is actively managing its portfolio, including a new Northfield Park Lease, which slightly decreased the fair value estimate to $35.48 per share.

**2. VICI: On The Dividend Dean's List At A Discount (NYSE:VICI)**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251226T143105 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- VICI Properties offers a 6.5% dividend yield with a strong, consistent dividend growth history and robust coverage ratios, suggesting it belongs on a "Dividend Dean's List." The company's intrinsic value is calculated at $31.66, which is above its current price, indicating potential for both yield and capital appreciation. While there is concentration risk due to its exposure to Las Vegas, management's plans for diversification and VICI's overall financial health help mitigate these concerns.

**3. VICI Properties: Will The REIT Die A Slow Death With Las Vegas?**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251226T080852 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- VICI Properties is trading at a multi-decade low valuation, offering a 6.5% yield and strong AFFO growth prospects. Market concerns about Las Vegas tourism declines and Caesars regional softness are considered overstated due to VICI’s resilient triple-net lease structure. With projected 12% annualized returns and over 30% upside to fair value, the author views this as a rare buying opportunity.
