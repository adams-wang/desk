**2. CoStar Group (CSGP): Rethinking Valuation After Google Tests Direct Homes‑for‑Sale Search Listings**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251216T162409 | Neutral | Relevance: 59%
- CoStar Group (CSGP) shares dropped following reports that Google is testing direct homes-for-sale listings in search results, a move that could disrupt the real estate platform market. Despite this "headline risk" and recent share price declines, the company appears undervalued based on its narrative fair value, buoyed by strong growth assumptions and its role as an industry standard. However, a high price-to-sales ratio suggests that its valuation might be rich, raising concerns about potential market sentiment shifts before earnings catch up.
