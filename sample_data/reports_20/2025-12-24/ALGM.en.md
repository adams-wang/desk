- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251223T051013 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- |Allegro MicroSystems (ALGM) saw a 4% climb after Micron Technology's upbeat revenue forecast boosted the semiconductor sector, especially AI-exposed chipmakers. Despite a recent rebound and significant revenue growth, ALGM is still trading below consensus price targets, leading to questions about whether it is an underappreciated AI enabler or if its growth is already priced in. The company's valuation narrative suggests it is undervalued, with a fair value of $38.58 against a current price of $26.70.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
