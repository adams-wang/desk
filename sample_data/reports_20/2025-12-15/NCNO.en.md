- nCino (NCNO) recently announced a new $100 million share repurchase program and upgraded earnings guidance, signaling management confidence despite a negative one-year shareholder return. The company's valuation narrative suggests it is 28.3% undervalued with a fair value of $35.54, driven by platform expansion and cross-sell opportunities.
