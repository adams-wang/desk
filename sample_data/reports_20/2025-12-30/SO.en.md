- Environmentalists and local residents are raising alarms about Alabama Power's coal ash storage near the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, dubbed the "American Amazon." They argue that the company's method of leaving over 21 million tons of toxic coal ash in unlined pits, secured only by earthen dikes, poses a significant threat to the region's biodiversity and could lead to environmental disaster if breached. Despite federal regulations and past fines for groundwater contamination, Alabama Power continues to store coal ash in ways that critics say are inadequate and prioritize profit over environmental protection.
