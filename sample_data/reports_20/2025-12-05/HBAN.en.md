- First Interstate BancSystem (FIBK) has been added to several S&P indices, which may increase institutional attention and liquidity but doesn't alter core investment risks related to loan growth, credit quality, and funding costs. The bank's maintained dividend of US$0.47 per share throughout 2025 highlights its commitment to income predictability amidst increasing criticized loans.
