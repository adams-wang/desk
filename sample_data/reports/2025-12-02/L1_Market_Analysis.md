    - Summary: The ERISA Industry Committee, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National Retail Federation filed a joint amicus brief supporting the dismissal of a 401(k) forfeiture complaint against Wells Fargo.

The brief aligns with the Department of Labor's stance in similar cases, suggesting that ERISA does not impose fiduciary liability for practices allowed under tax codes and which don't diminish participant benefits.
