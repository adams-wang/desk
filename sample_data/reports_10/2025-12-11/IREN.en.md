### Key Risks

1. High beta (4.24) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (19.7%, 1.4 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
4. Near-term weakness: 20.1% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).
