**1. Is AES Corporation Stock Underperforming the Nasdaq?**

- The AES Corporation, a global energy company with a market cap of $9.9 billion, operates in power generation and utilities across the U.S. and internationally. While AES has outperformed the Nasdaq Composite in the short term (up 7.2% vs. 3.5% over three months), its year-to-date and 52-week performance lags behind the index significantly. Despite this, the company's strong Q3 2025 results and reaffirmation of guidance have fueled investor confidence, with analysts maintaining a "Moderate Buy" rating and projecting a 14.2% upside.

**2. FLNC INVESTOR ALERT: Kirby McInerney LLP Reminds Fluence Energy, Inc. Investors of Looming Lead Plaintiff Deadline in Class Action Lawsuit**
- Source: FOX16.com | 20251216T040904 | Bearish | Relevance: 70%
- Kirby McInerney LLP has issued an investor alert reminding Fluence Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLNC) investors about the impending May 12, 2025, lead plaintiff deadline in a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that Fluence failed to disclose critical information regarding its relationships with major revenue sources, Siemens AG and The AES Corporation, and that its reported financial growth was unreliable due to aggressive revenue pull-forwards and earnings adjustments. These undisclosed issues led to significant stock price declines following a Blue Orca Capital report and Fluence's lowered fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance.
