- Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) stock soared on December 2, 2025, reaching near 52-week highs following news of a mostly cash bid from Netflix in an ongoing bidding war also involving Paramount Skydance and Comcast. The article details WBD's Q3 2025 financial performance, including strong studio and streaming results offset by declining ad revenue and high debt. It also covers analyst ratings, AI forecasts, and the potential outcomes of the sale process versus a planned split into two companies.

**2. Netflix and Paramount are now the favorites to buy Warner Bros., but investors don’t like it**
- Source: MarketWatch | 20251203T150700 | Bearish | Relevance: 99%
- Netflix and Paramount Skydance have become front-runners in the bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, but their respective share prices fell over 5% following reports of all-cash offers. Investors reacted negatively despite these companies being poised as likely winners in the acquisition battle. Netflix's shares dropped to an eight-month low after its all-cash bid for Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming businesses was reported.

**3. Exclusive | Netflix acquisition of Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max would face stiff DOJ antitrust opposition: sources**
- Source: New York Post | 20251203T190913 | Neutral | Relevance: 93%
- Netflix's potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and HBO Max streaming service is reportedly facing strong antitrust opposition from the Trump administration and the Justice Department. Officials are concerned that combining HBO Max's 100 million subscribers with Netflix's 300 million would create an entity double the size of its nearest competitor, Disney, and grant Netflix excessive pricing power over content and consumers. The DOJ likens the potential merger's anti-competitive impact to Ticketmaster controlling exclusive venues.

**4. Paramount and Netflix Both Stand to Lose If Netflix Wins the Warner Bros. Auction**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251204T200200 | Neutral | Relevance: 91%
- Netflix is reportedly the leading bidder to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio businesses, a move Morningstar believes would be value-destructive for Netflix. Conversely, while Paramount's bid for all of Warner Bros. could provide viability for its streaming service, the outcome for Paramount depends on the acquisition price. Morningstar maintains its fair value estimates for both Netflix and Paramount, noting that a Netflix win could lead to a decline in its fair value.
