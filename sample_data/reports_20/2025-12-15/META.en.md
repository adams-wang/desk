The firm reduced its FY26 and FY27 EPS estimates by approximately 8% due to higher operating expense expectations, now modeling $33 for FY27 EPS.

This discrepancy, highlighted by an Equilar analysis, shows Tesla directors' awards were disproportionately large at the time they were paid, leading to massive windfalls as the company's stock price appreciated. Despite a suspension of new stock grants since 2020 due to a shareholder lawsuit, the existing awards have generated substantial wealth, sparking criticism over director independence and the structure of their compensation.
