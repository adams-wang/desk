**1. Eisai Still Confident in Anti-Tau Asset as J&J Becomes Latest Victim in Spiraling Space**
- Source: BioSpace | 20251205T050829 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Eisai remains confident in its anti-tau asset, etalanetug, for Alzheimer's disease despite a series of recent failures in the anti-tau space by companies like Johnson & Johnson and UCB. Eisai's Chief Clinical Officer Lynn Kramer attributes these failures to not targeting the "critical" tau seeding region, a mechanism etalanetug is designed to address. The broader Alzheimer's research field is also exploring new targets beyond amyloid and tau, with inflammation emerging as a significant area of interest, alongside vascular dysfunction.

**2. J&J biologic Imaavy achieves EU first in generalised myasthenia gravis**

- Johnson & Johnson's monoclonal antibody Imaavy (nipocalimab) has received European Commission approval for treating generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) in patients aged 12 and older. This marks Imaavy as the first neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker approved in Europe for this condition, specifically for anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive patients. The approval is based on data showing superior disease control and a rapid reduction in immunoglobulin G levels.

**3. FDA panel unanimously votes against Johnson & Johnson MedTech interatrial shunt**

- An FDA advisory panel unanimously voted against granting approval to Johnson & Johnson MedTech's V-Wave Ventura interatrial shunt, citing that the risks of the device outweigh its benefits based on current data. While the device demonstrated safety and some benefits for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients, it showed no benefit for those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Johnson & Johnson plans to review the panel's recommendation and work with the FDA to determine next steps, as additional clinical evidence for HFrEF patients was recommended.
