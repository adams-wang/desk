- Valero Energy Corp (VLO) shares are under scrutiny after a U.S. strike in Venezuela halted the country's oil exports, impacting refiners that process heavy crude. While Venezuelan production and refining reportedly remain normal, the prolonged export freeze could affect Valero's crack spreads and margins, as investors await their Q4 earnings and commentary on crude sourcing on January 29th. The situation is exacerbated by broader geopolitical uncertainties and a market already sensitive to headline-driven swings.

- Valero (VLO) stock started 2026 higher, closing up 1.5% at $165.31, as oil prices remained around $61 a barrel with traders weighing oversupply against geopolitical risks. The company's next significant event is its Q4 and full-year 2025 earnings release and conference call on January 29th, with investors also monitoring the upcoming OPEC+ meeting for crude supply policy decisions. Valero and other U.S. refiners saw gains, while crude prices showed little change after their largest annual loss since 2020.

**5. Valero Energy stock rating reiterated at Buy by UBS on refining strength**
- Source: Investing.com | 20260106T160335 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- UBS has reiterated its Buy rating on Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) with a $190.00 price target due to stronger refining performance, representing a modest premium to its current price. The firm also raised its fourth-quarter 2025 EPS estimate to $3.31, anticipating further improvements in capture rates and renewable diesel earnings in 2026. This positive outlook from UBS contrasts with recent downgrades from other analysts like Mizuho and BofA Securities, which cited concerns over the refining outlook and geopolitical factors despite Valero's strong execution.
