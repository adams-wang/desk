- 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund focusing on companies with activist investor involvement, established a position in Tripadvisor, Inc. (TRIP) during Q3 2025. The fund highlighted Tripadvisor's undervaluation despite owning three strong businesses (Tripadvisor.com, Viator, and TheFork) which collectively generate significant revenue and are poised for growth. The fund attributes this discount to past governance issues, which have since been resolved, and a temporary decline in its core Tripadvisor business, while its other segments are growing rapidly.
