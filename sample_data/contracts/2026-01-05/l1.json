  "full_analysis": "## STEP 1: OBSERVE\n\n**VIX at 14.9**: At the 8th percentile of 52-week range (13.47-52.33), this is very calm - approaching complacency territory. The 9.6% 5-day increase is notable but from a very low base. No immediate stress.\n\n**Yield Curve at +65bps (10Y-3M)**: Positive and healthy. This is in the normal-to-flat zone - not steep (growth optimism) but definitely not inverted (recession signal). Late-cycle but supportive.\n\n**Breadth at 59.2%**: Near the top of the 20-day range (47.7%-59.2%). This indicates reasonably broad participation - not narrow/fragile. Just below the 60% \"strong\" threshold.\n\n**Put/Call at 1.27**: This is the outlier. A 42.8% 5-day spike to 1.27 is elevated - typically contrarian bullish (fear) but the speed of change suggests institutional hedging activity.\n\n**Economic Data**: Fed funds falling (3.88%), CPI stable (2.74%), unemployment stable (4.6%), no Sahm trigger. This is a goldilocks macro setup.\n\n## STEP 2: CONTEXTUALIZE WITH NEWS\n\nThe news flow is net positive (+0.28 sentiment, 9 bullish vs 1 bearish):\n\n1. **Geopolitical Contained**: Venezuela military operation is being treated as risk-on (Dow to new record). Markets pricing in containment, not escalation.\n\n2. **AI/Semiconductor Theme**: Memory shortage and supply constraints creating volatility in tech names (Micron). This is sector-specific, not systemic.\n\n3. **Corporate Strength**: Multiple earnings beats and positive investment outlooks (Microchip, Agree Realty, Boyd Gaming). Fundamentals supportive.\n\n4. **Upcoming Catalysts**: Jobs and inflation data flagged as key - market is data-watching mode ahead of Jan 28 FOMC.\n\n## STEP 3: IDENTIFY CONFLICTS\n\n**Primary Conflict**: VIX calm (14.9) vs Put/Call spiked (1.27, +43%)\n\nThis is the key divergence. When VIX is calm but put/call spikes, it often means:\n- Retail/algo positioning is calm (VIX)\n- Institutional/smart money is hedging (put/call)\n\nThis divergence preceded several corrections in history. It doesn't mean imminent crash, but suggests the surface calm may be masking hedging activity.\n\n**Secondary Conflict**: Geopolitical event as risk-on catalyst\n\nMarkets treating Venezuela operation as bullish (contained risk, domestic strength focus). But the put/call spike suggests some players are hedging tail risk. News says \"contained\" but options market says \"hedging.\"\n\n## STEP 4: SYNTHESIZE \u2192 REGIME\n\n**NORMAL** is the appropriate regime:\n- VIX in normal range (15-22 threshold, we're at 14.9 - just below)\n- Yield curve positive (no recession signal)\n- Breadth healthy (59.2%)\n- Economic data stable\n- No crisis indicators\n\nNot RISK_ON because:\n- Put/call divergence suggests caution\n- VIX rising from lows (9.6% in 5d)\n- Geopolitical uncertainty in background\n\nNot RISK_OFF because:\n- VIX still very low\n- Breadth healthy\n- No systemic stress signals\n\n**Regime Transition: STABLE** - No clear directional shift. Mixed signals suggest consolidation rather than acceleration in either direction.\n\n## STEP 5: NEWS RISK ADJUSTMENT\n\n**Assessment: -5%**\n\nThe put/call spike (+43% in 5 days to 1.27) is a forward-looking signal that VIX hasn't captured. Institutional hedging activity suggests:\n- Some players see risk VIX doesn't price\n- Geopolitical tail risk (Venezuela) may not be fully \"contained\"\n- Upcoming data (jobs/inflation) creating positioning uncertainty\n\nThis is NOT a -10% situation because:\n- News sentiment is net positive\n- Geopolitical event is being absorbed well\n- No immediate crisis catalyst\n\nBut it warrants modest caution (-5%) because:\n- Put/call divergence is meaningful\n- Hedging activity precedes VIX moves\n- Better to be slightly cautious than caught off-guard\n\n## CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM (0.68)\n\nMedium confidence because:\n- Clear data on VIX, yields, breadth (supportive)\n- But put/call divergence creates uncertainty\n- Geopolitical situation is fluid\n- Upcoming data releases could shift narrative",
