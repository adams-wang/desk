- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20260106T140824 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Kroger (KR) has been downgraded to Hold due to a deteriorating core grocery business, despite advancements in its digital strategy. The company is experiencing decelerating identical sales growth, significant headwinds in its pharmacy segment, and market share loss to competitors like Walmart and Costco.
