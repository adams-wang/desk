**1. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) Offers Upside, but Analysts Aren’t Fully Convinced**
- Source: Insider Monkey | 20251230T122400 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) is considered one of the ridiculously cheap stocks to buy now, with a significant upside potential despite mixed analyst ratings. Mizuho recently trimmed its price target to $75, aligning with consensus, due to macroeconomic data and management commentary indicating slower Q4 branded checkout growth and reduced Pay with Venmo growth forecasts. While analysts see potential, they are not fully convinced, with varying price targets suggesting both substantial upside and some downside risk for the stock.

**2. Morgan Stanley Reduces Price Target on PayPal Holdings (PYPL)**

- Morgan Stanley has reduced its price target on PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) from $74 to $51 and downgraded the stock from Equal Weight to Underweight. This revision is based on anticipated difficulties and time-consuming upgrades to PayPal's branded checkout integrations, along with predictions of slow dollar growth through 2028 due to various factors. The downgrade followed revised profit and margin projections by Morgan Stanley, and PayPal also reported a revenue miss and weak fourth-quarter guidance, despite exceeding EPS forecasts.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
