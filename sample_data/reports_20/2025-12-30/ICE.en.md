- Source: ts2.tech | 20251230T032039 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 73%
- S&P Global (SPGI) shares rose slightly on Monday, outperforming major U.S. indexes which were dragged down by tech stocks. Investors are focusing on interest rates and credit markets that influence SPGI's ratings and data demand, with upcoming catalysts including Fed minutes, jobless claims, and S&P Global's February 2026 earnings report and guidance. The company's unique revenue mix, which includes ratings, index revenue tied to issuance volumes, and subscription data, positions it differently from pure growth-heavy tech names.
