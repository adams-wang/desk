### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.01) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 3.4x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Market regime shift could impact high-beta names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 3.39 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (2.4x). Insider selling cluster ($1.1M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (4 buying vs 6 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 weakening modestly (-0.9% over 5 days). Below STRENGTH zone by 4.2pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.42x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 54. Volume at 38% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -SUL (Resistance).
