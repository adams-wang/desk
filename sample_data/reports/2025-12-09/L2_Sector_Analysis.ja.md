## セクター分析

### エグゼクティブサマリー
サイクル段階：MID_EXPANSION（中程度の信頼度）。ローテーションバイアス：NEUTRAL。重要な洞察：テクノロジーが唯一のアウトパフォーマーである極端なセクター集中により、NORMALマクロレジームの典型的な広範な参加とは矛盾する脆弱な市場構造が生じており、ミッドエクスパンション分類にもかかわらず、後期サイクルのダイナミクスが現れつつあることを示唆している。

### マーケットナラティブ
- テクノロジー：AIインフラ需要、半導体の強さ、クラウドコンピューティングの成長。
- エネルギー、消費財防衛、金融サービスの弱さ：原油価格の変動性、OPEC+の生産懸念、再生可能エネルギーへの転換；消費支出の圧力、利益率の圧縮、在庫問題。

### ローテーションサマリー
現在のローテーションパターンは、テクノロジーが唯一のアウトパフォーマーである極端に狭い市場を明らかにしており、NORMALマクロレジームから懸念すべき乖離を生んでいます。7つのセクターがAVOIDステータス、2つがTOXIC領域にあることから、これは著しい幅の悪化を表しています。XLK（+1.28% MRS_20）への集中に対し、インダストリアル（-1.48%）やフィナンシャル（-1.01%）などの伝統的なサイクlicalがアンダーパフォームしていることは、投資家がサイクリカルのレバレッジよりも成長品質を求めていることを示唆しています。防衛セクターの poor パフォーマンス（XLPが-2.01%、XLUが-5.38%）は、これは安全逃避ローテーションではなく、むしろ狭い成長志向のポジショニングであることを示しています。
