**2. RXO (RXO) Valuation Check as Margin Pressures and Negative S&P Outlook Challenge Recovery Prospects**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251222T110953 | Neutral | Relevance: 64%
- RXO (RXO) is facing challenges with margin pressures and a negative S&P outlook, prompting a valuation check. Despite recent share price declines, the company is considered 13% undervalued against a fair value of $15.59 due to its investment in AI-powered digital freight matching technology, which is expected to drive future margin and EBITDA growth. However, persistent automotive sector weakness and freight market softness could delay this recovery and challenge the optimistic AI-driven earnings narrative.
