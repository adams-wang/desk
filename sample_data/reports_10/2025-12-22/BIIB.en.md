**1. Biogen (BIIB) Stock News Today (Dec. 22, 2025): QALSODY Data, Nasdaq-100 Exit, and Analyst Forecasts**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251222T204512 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Biogen (BIIB) is in focus today, December 22, 2025, due to new long-term data for QALSODY in SOD1-ALS, the company's unexpected removal from the Nasdaq-100 index, and varying analyst forecasts. The stock's performance reflects a blend of these factors, with some analysts maintaining "Outperform" ratings while others are more cautious with "Reduce" or "Hold" stances. The key debate centers on whether new growth products like Leqembi can offset the decline in older franchises and the impact of the Nasdaq-100 reconstitution.

**2. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Neurology Publishes Long Term Results from the QALSODY Phase 3 VALOR Study and its Open-Label Extension in SOD1-ALS**
- Source: Biogen | 20251222T162710 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Biogen announced that long-term results from the QALSODY Phase 3 VALOR study and its open-label extension for SOD1-ALS have been published in JAMA Neurology. The data show that early initiation of QALSODY was associated with slower decline in clinical function, breathing, strength, and reduced risk of death or permanent ventilation, with a subset of participants regaining lost function and strength over three years. These findings emphasize QALSODY's impact on the underlying biology of SOD1-ALS and highlight its potential to improve outcomes for patients.

**3. Biogen Stock Forecast for the Week Ahead (Dec. 22–26, 2025): BIIB Near 52-Week High as Leqembi Momentum Meets an Analyst Split**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251221T230012 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ: BIIB) is approaching a 52-week high, driven by the momentum of its Alzheimer's drug Leqembi, despite a split among analysts regarding its future growth and profitability. The stock's performance in the upcoming holiday-shortened week will likely be influenced by institutional repositioning, macroeconomic data, and ongoing debates about Leqembi's market adoption versus legacy revenue declines and royalty concentration risks.

**4. RBC’s Confidence in Leqembi and MS Pipeline Might Change The Case For Investing In Biogen (BIIB)**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251220T123845 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- RBC Capital has reaffirmed its positive outlook on Biogen, emphasizing the strength of its neurology franchise and the potential of Leqembi for Alzheimer's and BIIB145 for Multiple Sclerosis. This endorsement highlights Biogen's expertise in neurological diseases and suggests a more resilient business model, though Biogen's future still heavily depends on the successful performance of a few key drug launches. The upcoming BIIB145 clinical trial is particularly significant to offset generic pressures on existing MS revenues.

**5. Biogen’s QALSODY shows sustained benefits for SOD1-ALS patients**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251222T170834 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Biogen announced sustained benefits from its QALSODY treatment for SOD1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) over 3.5 years, showing slower decline and reduced risk of death. The drug, approved in 44 countries, is undergoing further study to evaluate its potential in delaying ALS onset in presymptomatic individuals, while recent activities for Biogen include varied analyst ratings and collaborations.
