-  Jim Cramer advises investors to sell shares of Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) and IREN, noting that Oklo is a pre-revenue company with significant losses, despite its potential in nuclear power. He suggests that the "year of magical investing" has ended and points to certain AI stocks as offering greater upside potential with less risk.

**2. Nvidia CEO Says Nuclear Is AI's Future — Oklo, NuScale Ready To Roar Back?**
- Source: Benzinga | 20251205T130934 | Bullish | Relevance: 99%
- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang highlighted nuclear energy, specifically Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), as the essential power solution for the rapidly expanding AI sector. This strong endorsement from an AI industry leader aims to alleviate skepticism surrounding SMR developers like NuScale Power Corp., Nano Nuclear Energy, Inc., and Oklo, Inc., whose stocks faced a downturn in November. Huang's projection of hundreds of megawatt-range SMRs powering data centers within six to seven years provides a credible timeline and shifts focus from the companies' risk to the significant market opportunity presented by AI's energy demands.

**3. The Nuclear Revival Is Real: SMR Stocks Flash Buy Signals After DOE Push**

-  The U.S. Department of Energy's $800 million funding for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) has signaled a true nuclear revival, validating next-generation nuclear technology and creating a powerful tailwind for companies like NuScale Power and Oklo Inc. NuScale benefits from having the only NRC-certified SMR design, while Oklo capitalizes on its AI-energy narrative and unique build-own-operate model, positioning both as key investment opportunities. This government backing and market demand for AI data centers are transitioning SMRs from research to commercial deployment.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TOXIC (Zone G) | 0.25x |

*NORMAL regime with stabilizing volatility and moderate risk appetite. Fed in data-dependent mode with 7 days to FOMC—soft economic data (retail -4.67% MoM, CPI 2.89% rising) offsetting labor resilience. AI infrastructure demand and capital reallocation themes dominating corporate narratives, signaling selective risk-on in growth/tech segments. Narrow breadth (52% above 50MA) and neutral put/call suggest complacency but not excess—standard late-cycle positioning amid policy uncertainty.*
