|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderately constructive conditions. Fed dovish pivot expectations from weak jobs data and declining VIX suggest improving risk appetite, though narrow breadth at 51% indicates selective participation. Focus on quality sectors benefiting from rate cut expectations.*
