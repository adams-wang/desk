|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
