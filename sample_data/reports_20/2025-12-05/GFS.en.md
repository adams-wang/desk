- Analyst Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities has reiterated a Sell rating on GlobalFoundries Inc. despite its positioning in the AI technologies market, raising the price target to $37.00. The Sell rating is attributed to the expectation that significant revenue from AI strategies will only materialize beyond 2027, with limited immediate financial impact from recent acquisitions.
