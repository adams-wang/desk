- First Solar (FSLR) has emerged as a dominant outlier amidst a turbulent renewable energy sector characterized by high interest rates and political shifts, demonstrating resilience and record earnings. The company's unique "policy-insulated" business model, based on thin-film technology and vertically integrated domestic manufacturing, has solidified its position in the utility-scale market.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
