**2. Zscaler, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ZS) 27% Share Price Plunge Could Signal Some Risk**

-  Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) has experienced a 27% share price drop in the last month, despite a 22% gain over the past year. The company's current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 13.7x is significantly higher than the industry average, which could indicate overvaluation, especially given that analyst forecasts suggest Zscaler's revenue growth will lag behind the industry. This high P/S combined with a predicted slowdown in growth may signal future disappointment for investors if the P/S ratio corrects.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with stabilizing volatility and moderate risk appetite. Fed in data-dependent mode with 7 days to FOMC—soft economic data (retail -4.67% MoM, CPI 2.89% rising) offsetting labor resilience. AI infrastructure demand and capital reallocation themes dominating corporate narratives, signaling selective risk-on in growth/tech segments. Narrow breadth (52% above 50MA) and neutral put/call suggest complacency but not excess—standard late-cycle positioning amid policy uncertainty.*
