- Bank of America has lowered its price target for Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) from $18.00 to $17.00, maintaining an "underperform" rating due to an implied 2% downside. This reflects broad negative analyst sentiment, with a consensus "Reduce" rating and a target price of $20.00 from other firms.

- Conagra Brands, Inc. recorded a non-cash goodwill and brand impairment charge of $968 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, primarily due to a significant decline in its share price and market capitalization over the past year. This charge led to a net loss of $664 million for the quarter, contrasting with a profit in the prior year, alongside a 7% decrease in sales driven by portfolio reshaping and other market headwinds. Despite these challenges, the company reaffirmed its fiscal year outlook for organic net sales and adjusted EPS, anticipating a return to growth in the second half.

While a large valuation gap suggests potential upside based on future earnings growth forecasts, the current results indicate ongoing profitability and margin pressures.
