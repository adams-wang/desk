**1. General Motors' Q4 US Sales Fall 7% Y/Y: Is EV Weakness the Reason?**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20260107T151220 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- General Motors reported a 7% year-over-year decline in Q4 2025 US sales, delivering 703,001 vehicles, with EV sales sharply dropping by 43%. Despite this quarterly dip, the company led the U.S. auto market for the full year, increasing sales by 6% and maintaining its leadership in full-size pickups and SUVs. This performance contrasts with rivals like Tesla and Ford, who showed mixed results in the same period.

**2. GM: Fourth-Quarter Sales Down, but Full Year Excellent**
- Source: Morningstar | 20260106T191413 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- General Motors' US sales in the fourth quarter fell 6.9% year over year, though full-year sales increased by 5.5%. Despite a drop in EV sales for the quarter, key vehicles like full-size pickups and certain SUVs performed well, contributing to strong overall yearly results. Morningstar maintains its "no-moat" rating and $80 fair value estimate for GM, noting the company's low discounting in 2025 suggests flexibility for 2026 amid an expected industry sales decline.

**3. GM Tops US Auto Sales in 2025 Despite Q4 Dip: Time to Buy the Stock?**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20260106T181017 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- General Motors (GM) led US auto sales in 2025, selling 2.85 million units, a 5.5% increase, despite a 7% dip in Q4 sales and a 43% drop in EV deliveries during the same period. The company's market share grew to 17%, and it maintained its leadership in full-size pickups for the sixth consecutive year. Despite the Q4 slowdown, GM's strong market position, growth in software services, and restructuring efforts in China, coupled with a robust liquidity profile and stock buybacks, suggest it remains an attractive investment.

**4. GM Tops US Auto Sales in 2025 Despite Q4 Dip: Time to Buy the Stock?**

- General Motors (GM) led U.S. auto sales in 2025, with a 5.5% increase in deliveries, outperforming Toyota. Despite a 7% dip in Q4 sales, including a 43% drop in EV deliveries, GM anticipates resilient demand into 2026 and sees strong growth in its software and services business. Analysts recommend GM as a "Strong Buy" due to its undervaluation compared to peers and positive profit growth outlook.

### Market Context

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
