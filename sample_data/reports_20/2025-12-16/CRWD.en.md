While both are critical players in protecting organizations from cyberattacks, CrowdStrike appears to have an edge due to its stronger growth momentum and focus on AI-driven solutions.

- Fortinet (FTNT) has a premium valuation, with a Price-to-Book ratio of 85.71, raising concerns despite strong third-quarter 2025 results. While the company demonstrates operational strength and growth in key cybersecurity segments, decelerating service revenue growth and conservative guidance suggest limited upside at current levels.

- Radware cybersecurity specialists predict that 2026 will see a significant shift towards an "Internet of Agents," where machine-to-machine activity, automated agents, and AI will dominate internet traffic, threat landscapes, and defense strategies. This shift will make APIs the primary attack surface and intensify AI-enhanced social engineering and denial-of-service attacks. Consequently, regulatory demands will tighten, and there will be a greater focus on zero-day vulnerabilities, runtime security, and machine identities for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity measures.
