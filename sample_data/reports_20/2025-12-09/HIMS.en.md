### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.41) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Heavy insider selling: $13M sold (25 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation risk: PEG 5.2x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
4. High short interest (36.7%, 2.2 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
5. Long-term trend broken: trading 13.3% below SMA200.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +8.1% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
