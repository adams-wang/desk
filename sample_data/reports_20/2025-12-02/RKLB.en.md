3. Elevated short interest (9.7%): bears positioning against stock.
4. Near-term weakness: 23.0% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -14.6% to -10.3% (+4.3% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 14.3pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -8.8% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 9.1pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.12x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). Volume at 58% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
