- Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) has seen a significant rally, up 60% year-to-date, prompting a reevaluation of its valuation. While the narrative suggests a 19.4% undervaluation with a fair value near $1,181 due to its transformation into a full-service silicon solutions provider, the stock's P/E ratio of 24x is cheaper than the industry average but raises questions about cushion if growth falters. Investors should consider potential risks like normalizing AI data center demand or compressed margins before making investment decisions.
