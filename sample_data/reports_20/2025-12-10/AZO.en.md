-  AutoZone's stock experienced a modest pullback in early December, presenting a potential buying opportunity despite Q1 results being slightly below analyst expectations, as the company remains in a robust long-term uptrend. The pullback is attributed to "weak" Q1 results, but underlying data shows strong sales growth and operational resilience, with analysts reaffirming a bullish outlook and institutions accumulating the stock. The technical setup, combined with analyst and institutional support, suggests a continuation of its uptrend.

The miss was attributed to LIFO gross margin headwinds and elevated SG&A expenses, yet robust commercial growth and planned store expansion suggest future momentum.

| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
