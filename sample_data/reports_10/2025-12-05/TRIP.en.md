**1. 13D Activist Fund Established a Position in TripAdvisor (TRIP) in Q3**

-  13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund focusing on companies with activist investor involvement, established a position in Tripadvisor, Inc. (TRIP) during Q3 2025. The fund highlighted Tripadvisor's undervaluation despite owning three strong businesses (Tripadvisor.com, Viator, and TheFork) which collectively generate significant revenue and are poised for growth. The fund attributes this discount to past governance issues, which have since been resolved, and a temporary decline in its core Tripadvisor business, while its other segments are growing rapidly.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with stabilizing volatility and moderate risk appetite. Fed in data-dependent mode with 7 days to FOMC—soft economic data (retail -4.67% MoM, CPI 2.89% rising) offsetting labor resilience. AI infrastructure demand and capital reallocation themes dominating corporate narratives, signaling selective risk-on in growth/tech segments. Narrow breadth (52% above 50MA) and neutral put/call suggest complacency but not excess—standard late-cycle positioning amid policy uncertainty.*
