**1. Ford pivots away from its electric vehicle plans amid financial losses, waning demand**
- Source: MLive.com | 20251216T151100 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Ford Motor Co. is shifting away from its ambitious electric vehicle aspirations due to significant financial losses and declining consumer interest. The company plans to focus more on efficient gasoline engines and hybrid electric vehicles, as evidenced by the discontinuation of the all-electric F-150 Lightning and the repurposing of its EV manufacturing facilities. This strategic change aims to achieve a more profitable and resilient Ford, with a target of hybrids, extended-range EVs, and full EVs accounting for half of its global volume by 2030.

- Ford Motor announced it expects to take approximately $19.5 billion in charges, primarily attributed to its electric-vehicle division, due to declining EV demand. This significant impairment signals a major setback for the U.S. auto industry's electric-vehicle aspirations. The automaker is now shifting its focus towards hybrid gas-and-electric vehicles.

**3. Gene Munster Says Ford's EV Pullback Could Be Beneficial For Tesla — Gary Black Says 'Ford Can't Make Money...'**
- Source: Benzinga | 20251216T060756 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management and Gary Black of The Future Fund LLC have commented on Ford Motor Co.'s recent EV pullback. Munster believes Ford's retreat from EVs will benefit Tesla, making it harder for Ford to build autonomous vehicles. Black suggests Ford's pivot to hybrids is an admission that it cannot profit from launching EV brand extensions of popular models like the F-150 Lightning, which Ford has now ceased production of.

**4. Ford to repurpose BlueOval SK Battery Park; 1,500 to lose jobs**
- Source: The Courier-Journal | 20251215T211012 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Ford Motor Co. is dramatically changing its electric vehicle strategy by converting its BlueOval SK Battery Park in Glendale, Kentucky, from an EV battery production facility to one that produces battery energy storage systems. This shift will result in the layoff of 1,500 current BlueOval SK employees, although Ford plans to hire 2,100 workers for the new business segment. The decision comes after Ford and SK On ended their joint EV battery venture and amid a reversal of federal support for the electric vehicle sector by the Trump administration.

**5. Ford to record $19.5 billion in special charges related to EV pullback**
- Source: CNBC | 20251215T210824 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Ford Motor expects to record approximately $19.5 billion in special charges, primarily in the fourth quarter, due to restructuring business priorities and scaling back its all-electric vehicle investments. This strategic shift includes refocusing on hybrid vehicles, canceling some large EV truck plans for smaller models, and rebalancing investments in core products like trucks and SUVs. Ford aims for profitability in its Model e electric vehicle business by 2029 and anticipates improving profits in traditional units, projecting 50% of its global volume to be hybrids, EREVs, and fully electric vehicles by 2030.
