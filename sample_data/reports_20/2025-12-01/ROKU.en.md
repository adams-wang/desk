MRS_20 strengthening from -5.8% to -4.0% (+1.8% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 8.0pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (0.6%) - potential reversal signal. AM_20 at -3.1% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 4.8pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.14x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 47. Volume at 48% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.
