-  McDonald's experienced a "strange and often contradictory year," characterized by successful marketing promotions like the Grinch Meal, which boosted traffic due to unique giveaways. However, the company struggles with maintaining momentum between promotions, as evidenced by its new franchising standards focused on ensuring "value" amidst rising menu prices. This dichotomy highlights the chain's reliance on experiential campaigns to drive traffic while trying to address consumer concerns about everyday affordability.

-  McDonald's Netherlands released an AI-generated Christmas ad that reimagines "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year" as "the most terrible time of the year," garnering significant online backlash. While many criticized McDonald's for using AI to avoid employing real people, the ad's creators defended it, stating they put immense effort into writing prompts and refining shots for what they called a "challenge," not an "experiment." They also highlighted AI's use for flexible and fast production, as a live-action version would have been too expensive.
