**2. Zscaler, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ZS) 27% Share Price Plunge Could Signal Some Risk**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251203T053029 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) has experienced a 27% share price drop in the last month, despite a 22% gain over the past year. The company's current price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 13.7x is significantly higher than the industry average, which could indicate overvaluation, especially given that analyst forecasts suggest Zscaler's revenue growth will lag behind the industry. This high P/S combined with a predicted slowdown in growth may signal future disappointment for investors if the P/S ratio corrects.
