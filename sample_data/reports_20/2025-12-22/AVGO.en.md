**5. Why Nvidia maintains its moat and Gemini won’t kill OpenAI**
- Source: SiliconANGLE | 20251221T210924 | Neutral | Relevance: 71%
- This article argues against two prevailing market narratives: that Nvidia's competitive moat is eroding due to alternatives like TPUs, and that Google's Gemini AI model will dominate and ultimately surpass OpenAI. The authors contend that Nvidia's forthcoming products, like the GB300, will reset AI economics and reinforce its market leadership, while Google faces an innovator's dilemma with its ad-dependent search business that will challenge its ability to integrate AI chatbots profitably. OpenAI, despite challenges, is positioned to disrupt online experiences by focusing on trusted information over ads, maintaining a strong position alongside Nvidia in the AI era.
