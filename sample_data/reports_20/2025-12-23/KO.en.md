- Coca-Cola, a mega-cap company with a $302 billion market value, is known for its strong brand, global presence, and being a Dividend King. While its stability and dividend record make it attractive for risk-averse investors, its historical performance suggests it's unlikely to be a "millionaire-maker" stock, as its returns have trailed the S&P 500. The article suggests that due to its modest growth potential, other stocks may offer better returns for those aiming for substantial gains.

- The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is concluding 2025 with significant investor-relevant news, including a confirmed CEO transition with Henrique Braun succeeding James Quincey in 2026, and renewed discussions around potentially selling Costa Coffee.

- Coca-Cola is reportedly in talks with private equity firm TDR to sell most of its Costa Coffee business, a brand it acquired in 2018. This potential sale, valued significantly less than its original purchase price, signals Coca-Cola's strategic move to offload underperforming assets and could serve as a gauge for investor confidence in the beverage giant. The company aims to retain a small stake and will not sell its Costa Coffee operations in China.
