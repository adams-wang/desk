### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.92) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Heavy insider selling: $75M sold (18 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 9.9x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. High short interest (19.8%, 1.5 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 6 raises (avg +52%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 9.90 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 38.0x attractive for 44% earnings growth. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (2.5x). Revenue growth strong at 66% YoY. Analyst sentiment positive (6 raises, avg +52%). Insider selling cluster ($75.0M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).
