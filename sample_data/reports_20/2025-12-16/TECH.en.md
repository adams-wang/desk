- Bio-Techne Corporation (TECH), a mid-cap life sciences company, has underperformed the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) year-to-date and over the past 52 weeks, despite a recent three-month gain. The company's Q1 2026 revenue declined due to headwinds in cell therapy timing and biotech funding softness. Despite its recent struggles, analysts maintain a "Strong Buy" rating for TECH with a significant upside to its mean price target.

- Neuberger Berman Group LLC reduced its stake in Bio-Techne Corp (NASDAQ:TECH) by 17.4% in Q2, now holding 2,499,969 shares valued at approximately $128.62 million. Despite this reduction, institutional ownership remains high at 98.95%, with other firms like Select Equity L.P. and Norges Bank increasing their positions. Analysts maintain a "Moderate Buy" rating for Bio-Techne, with a consensus target price of $71.00, even as Q3 revenues missed estimates and the stock trades at a high P/E ratio.

**3. Pinning Down Bio-Techne Corporation's (NASDAQ:TECH) P/S Is Difficult Right Now**
- Source: 富途牛牛 | 20251214T130858 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Bio-Techne Corporation (NASDAQ:TECH) currently has a high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 7.5x compared to the Life Sciences industry median of 3.3x, making it appear overvalued. Despite recent respectable revenue growth aligning with industry averages, the market seems to be ignoring these growth expectations, leading to a potentially unsustainable P/S ratio. Investors should be cautious as the high P/S might not be justified by its growth outlook, posing a risk of disappointment if the P/S ratio adjusts to reflect more average growth.

**4. Bio-Techne Stock: Is TECH Underperforming the Healthcare Sector?**
- Source: Markets Financial Content | 20251216T074000 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 99%
- Bio-Techne Corporation (TECH) has shown underperformance compared to the broader healthcare sector (XLV), with its stock decreasing almost 26% from its 52-week high. While it gained 13.7% in the past three months, it lagged XLV's 14% gain. The company's recent Q1 2026 revenue decline due to cell therapy timing and biotech funding softness contributed to investor concerns, despite analysts maintaining a "Strong Buy" rating.
