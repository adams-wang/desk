- This holiday season, Walmart is catering to two distinct consumer groups: lower-to-middle income shoppers focusing on necessities, and a growing segment of affluent customers drawn by store renovations and upscale products. While lower-income individuals face rising prices and stagnant wages, wealthier consumers drive increased spending due to stock market gains and higher income growth, leading to a "K-shaped" economic recovery. This shift sees even budget retailers like Dollar Tree and Dollar General attracting higher-earning individuals, raising concerns among some analysts about where lower-income consumers will find affordable options.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
