### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

PEG ratio 0.20 indicates undervaluation relative to growth. Forward P/E 86.6x attractive for 256% earnings growth. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (2.7x). Insider selling cluster ($19.6M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (4 buying vs 6 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -5.1% to -2.5% (+2.6% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 6.5pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (1.2%) - potential reversal signal. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.16x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 51. Volume at 59% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
