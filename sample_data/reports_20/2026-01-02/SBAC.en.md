**1. LTC Properties (LTC) Maintains Monthly Dividend of $0.19/Share**
- Source: GuruFocus | 20260102T151013 | Neutral | Relevance: 57%
- LTC Properties (LTC) will maintain its monthly dividend of $0.19 per share, resulting in a forward yield of 6.64%. The company has expanded its credit facility to $800 million and increased its 2025 SHOP NOI guidance, demonstrating strategic financial moves and a growing focus on senior housing operations. While LTC shows strong operational efficiency and revenue growth, investors should consider its significant reliance on debt, potential overvaluation based on its P/E ratio, and a high dividend payout ratio despite strong institutional ownership.
