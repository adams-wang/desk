- Gilead Sciences announced positive topline results from its Phase 3 ARTISTRY-2 trial, demonstrating that its investigational single-tablet regimen of bictegravir and lenacapavir (BIC/LEN) met the primary endpoint for non-inferiority in HIV treatment compared to BIKTARVY. This novel combination, which combines an integrase strand transfer inhibitor with a first-in-class capsid inhibitor, was generally well tolerated and could expand future treatment options for virologically suppressed adults with HIV. The company plans to use these results, alongside those from the ARTISTRY-1 trial, for regulatory submissions.
