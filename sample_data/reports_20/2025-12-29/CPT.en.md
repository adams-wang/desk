### Key Risks

1. Volume divergence: price rising (+0.8% MRS) on declining volume (50% of avg) suggests distribution.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 9.0x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 8.96 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 82.3x stretched relative to 17% growth. Quality metrics strong (margin 17%). Analyst sentiment negative (1 target cuts vs 0 raises). Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 improving modestly (+0.8% over 5 days). Below STRENGTH zone by 0.0pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 at 1.3% confirms short-term momentum alignment. AM_20 at 4.4% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 3.6pp, stock-specific strength. Below SMA200 (1.00x), long-term trend not supportive. Volume at 50% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +MTL (Rally).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
