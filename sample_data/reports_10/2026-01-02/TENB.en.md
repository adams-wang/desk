- Morgan Stanley and Jefferies have both reduced their price targets for Tenable (TENB), citing that while cybersecurity software will remain durable in 2026, platform-based companies are outperforming standalone solutions. The firms reported varied performance within the cybersecurity sector, with platforms rising significantly while other areas declined. Despite the lowered price targets, Tenable recently secured a significant OneGov agreement with the US General Services Administration (GSA) to provide its FedRAMP-authorized Cloud Security solution to federal agencies through March 2027.
