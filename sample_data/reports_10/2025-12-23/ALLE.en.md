**1. Owens Corning (OC): Assessing Valuation After a 32% Year-to-Date Share Price Decline**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251221T100846 | Neutral | Relevance: 60%
- Owens Corning (OC) has experienced a 32% year-to-date share price decline, despite a solid long-term track record. The article suggests that OC might be undervalued, with a fair value estimated at $140.56 per share, compared to its current $114.54 close, driven by strategic shifts towards higher-margin products and cost synergies. However, persistent weakness in construction markets poses a risk to this undervaluation thesis.
