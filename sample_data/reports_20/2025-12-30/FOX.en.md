### Catalysts

- AI/machine learning initiatives could drive multiple expansion if executed.

### Technicals

MRS_20 stable at 3.7% (minimal 5-day change). Below STRENGTH zone by 0.3pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 at 1.0% confirms short-term momentum alignment. AM_20 at 3.9% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI overbought at 76, risk of mean reversion. Volume at 58% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +MUL (Resistance test).
