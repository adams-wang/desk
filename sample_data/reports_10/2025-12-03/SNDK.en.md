-  Sandisk has officially joined the S&P 500 index after experiencing a significant surge in its stock value this year, driven by demand from the AI boom. The company's shares are up over 500% since its spin-off from Western Digital in February, pushing its market capitalization above $31 billion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 is often seen as a positive catalyst for a company's shares, and this move follows the acquisition of Interpublic Group by Omnicom Group, which opened a spot in the index.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
