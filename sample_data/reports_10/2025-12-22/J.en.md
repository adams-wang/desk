- Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) appears deeply discounted with strong free cash flow, but its weak margins, high leverage, and historical project execution issues raise concerns.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251222T050950 | Neutral | Relevance: 57%
- Primoris Services Corporation (NYSE: PRIM) has been added to the S&P 1000 index, which could increase its visibility among institutional investors and index-tracking funds, potentially affecting its trading activity and liquidity. While the index inclusion offers modest liquidity support, Primoris's investment narrative remains heavily reliant on securing contracts for data center, power delivery, and renewable infrastructure. Investors should consider the company's exposure to winning high-quality data center and utility-scale renewable projects, particularly given its raised Q3 2025 net income guidance.
