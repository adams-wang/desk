- **Thesis:** VALUE

### Position Sizing

- **Shares:** 112
- **Position Value:** $33,153.12
- **Portfolio %:** 33.15%
- **Risk Dollars:** $1,200.00
- **Risk Per Trade:** 1.20%

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*

| Quarter | Est | Actual | Surprise |
|---------|-----|--------|----------|
| 2025Q4 | $2.50 | $2.67 | +6.9% |
| 2025Q3 | $2.45 | $2.62 | +7.0% |
