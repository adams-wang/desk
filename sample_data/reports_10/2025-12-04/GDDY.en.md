- GoDaddy (GDDY) has expanded its agentic AI offerings with six new Airo.ai agents and an expanded Agent Name Service, aiming to deepen its digital solutions strategy. Despite recent stock price weakness, analysts see upside, and the company's shift towards recurring, higher-margin revenue streams through AI-driven products suggests potential undervaluation, with a fair value estimated at $175.06. Investors are encouraged to assess whether this presents a mispriced growth opportunity or if the market has already accounted for these advancements.
