-  Truist analyst William Stein maintained a Hold rating on Analog Devices (ADI) while increasing its price target to $258 due to strong Q3 performance driven by its automotive business and an optimistic Q4 outlook fueled by AI. Analog Devices demonstrated significant growth in revenue, operating cash flow, and free cash flow in fiscal Q4 2025, primarily from its Industrial and Communications segments, returning a substantial portion of FCF to shareholders.
