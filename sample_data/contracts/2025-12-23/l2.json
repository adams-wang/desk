Holiday-thinned conditions and VIX at 52-week lows suggest complacency, which aligns with our mixed rotation patterns.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nSignals validated: 3 NEUTRAL (noise zones), 4 WEAKENING (positive positioning turning negative), 4 AVOID (ignition zones with negative momentum). No anomalies detected vs thresholds.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: E (3 sectors in noise), B (4 sectors weakening), D (4 sectors in ignition). No momentum (F) or trend (A) zones active. Direction is mixed with widespread deterioration.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nL1 AGGRESSIVE vs L2 NEUTRAL conflict resolved by holiday conditions and underlying sector weakness. VIX complacency masks rotation deterioration. Focus on quality positioning ahead of 2026 catalysts.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nEARLY_EXPANSION classification reflects Technology's relative leadership and defensive sector weakness, but LOW confidence due to lack of clear cyclical patterns. No strong momentum zones and widespread sector deterioration suggest cycle uncertainty in holiday-thinned conditions.\n\nKey Insight: Despite L1's AGGRESSIVE stance, sector rotation reveals underlying weakness with 8 of 11 sectors showing deteriorating momentum, suggesting markets are consolidating in holiday conditions rather than establishing sustainable leadership patterns for 2026."
