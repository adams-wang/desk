- The Delaware Supreme Court has restored Elon Musk's 2018 Tesla pay package, overturning a lower court's decision that had previously invalidated the $56 billion compensation deal. This ruling means Musk can now receive compensation for his work since 2018, with the package currently valued at approximately $155 billion due to Tesla's stock price increase. Shareholders also approved a new, even larger pay plan in November that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla meets future targets.

**4. Omnicom Group (OMC): Is the Recent Share Price Rebound Leaving the Stock Undervalued?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251218T001053 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- Omnicom Group has seen a recent share price rebound, with the stock up 13% in the past month. Despite this momentum, the company is still slightly negative year-to-date and is considered undervalued with a narrative fair value near $101.56 against its last close of $82.70. This undervaluation is supported by disciplined cost management, operational restructuring, and anticipated synergy targets, with potential risks from integration hurdles and AI-driven in-housing by clients.

IMPINJ has a Strong Buy consensus from analysts, despite a reported net loss in the last quarter and negative corporate insider sentiment due to increased selling activity. Hardwick has a 10.3% average return and 68.57% success rate on recommended stocks according to TipRanks.
