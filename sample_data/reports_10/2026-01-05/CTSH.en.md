**1. IBM (IBM) Valuation Check After Recent Pullback and Strong 1-Year Run**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T012327 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- IBM (IBM) has experienced a recent pullback, dropping 5% over the past month, but still boasts a strong 34.31% return over the past year. Analysts generally see a slim upside from its current price of $291.5, with a consensus target of $281.316, although some bullish forecasts reach $350. The article questions whether IBM's future growth from hybrid cloud and AI is already factored into its current valuation, noting its P/E ratio is higher than peers, yet Simply Wall St's fair ratio suggests potential for the market to edge higher.
