**3. Joby Aviation: Upcoming FAA Certification Doesn't Justify Dilution, Premium, And Cash-Burn Risks**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251214T150847 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Joby Aviation remains a "Hold" despite progress towards FAA certification and flight tests, due to uncertain paths to mass commercialization and profitability, and elevated commuter pricing. The company's robust cash position offers a few quarters of runway, but further dilutive capital raises may be necessary given its lack of operating leverage. Expensive valuations, ongoing equity dilution, and a high short ratio contribute to a minimal margin of safety, making it prudent to remain on the sidelines.
