- Otis Worldwide recently completed a significant installation for Montréal's Réseau Express Métropolitain (REM), providing 22 escalators and 57 custom elevators with a 5-year service contract. This project reinforces Otis's investment narrative focused on modernization and IoT, particularly in connected services and real-time monitoring. While the REM win supports a deeper engagement in high-margin service relationships, investors should still consider concerns about soft organic growth and declining free cash flow margins affecting the near-term outlook for OTIS.
