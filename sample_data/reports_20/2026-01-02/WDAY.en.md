- Recent research from Gartner, Phenom, and others indicates that despite accelerated AI adoption in HR, many organizations struggle to realize its promised value and ROI. This "AI ROI problem" stems not from the technology or employee resistance, but from a lack of strategic governance and proper implementation frameworks. The studies highlight a widespread "maturity problem," with most organizations stuck in early-stage experimentation, alongside an "enthusiasm gap" where employee interest in AI outpaces organizational capacity to leverage it effectively.

This article explores ADP's historical context, business model, financial performance, leadership, competitive landscape, risks, and opportunities, concluding that its current valuation may represent a significant "buy the dip" moment for a reliable market compounder.

- ServiceNow (NOW) stock fell over 3% as software shares experienced a slide on Friday, driven by investor repricing of high-growth cloud software companies. Attention is now shifting to upcoming economic reports, including the U.S. monthly employment and consumer price index data, which will influence interest-rate expectations and the valuation of growth-sensitive stocks. The company's recent acquisition of Armis for $7.75 billion and its focus on AI features are being watched to see how they impact subscription growth and margins.
