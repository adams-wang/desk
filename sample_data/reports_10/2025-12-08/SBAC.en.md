- American Tower (AMT) recently declared an increased quarterly dividend of US$1.70 per share and issued US$850.00 million in senior unsecured notes, prompting a re-evaluation of its investment profile. The company's strategy combines shareholder payouts with long-term debt financing, reinforcing its income appeal but also highlighting its reliance on debt markets. Investors are weighing the impact of dependable dividends against the balance sheet risk associated with American Tower's high leverage, especially as its shares trade below analyst and estimated fair values.
