**5. Tariffs to set US materials up for best earnings in five years**
- Source: The Edge Malaysia | 20251230T120827 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 63%
- US materials stocks, including steelmakers and packaging manufacturers, are projected to achieve their highest earnings growth in five years, rising 20% in 2026, primarily due to tariffs and strategic volume plays. Metals and packaging industries are expected to see the most significant boost, with earnings growth over 30%, driven by trade protections strengthening steel prices and increasing demand for consumer goods packaging. While tariffs create headwinds for some, cost-cutting measures and anticipated interest rate cuts are also contributing factors across the broader materials sector.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
