- Lululemon Athletica, Inc. founder Chip Wilson is initiating a proxy fight to appoint three new independent directors to the company's Board, including the former co-CEO of On Holding, a former CMO of ESPN, and a former CEO of Activision. Wilson also proposes declassifying the Board so all directors are elected annually, emphasizing the need for visionary leadership due to what he perceives as a lack of board oversight and a failing succession plan for the outgoing CEO, Calvin McDonald. This move follows activist investor Elliott Management's stake acquisition and their intent to push their own CEO candidate.

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
