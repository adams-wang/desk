- Eastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) makes extensive use of debt, with net debt around US$4.73 billion. While its EBIT covers interest expenses, its liabilities, totaling US$7.37 billion more than its cash and near-term receivables, exceed its US$7.34 billion market capitalization, suggesting potential risk.

**3. These 4 Measures Indicate That Eastman Chemical (NYSE:EMN) Is Using Debt Extensively**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T132512 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Eastman Chemical Company (NYSE:EMN) utilizes debt, holding US$5.21b in debt against US$489.0m in cash, resulting in net debt of approximately US$4.73b as of September 2025. The company's liabilities of US$7.37b also exceed its US$7.34b market capitalization. Despite its interest expense being covered 5.7 times by EBIT, a cautious outlook is warranted due to less-than-expected free cash flow generation and liabilities outpacing assets.

- Eastman Chemical Company's stock presents a complex picture, with its share price breaking above key technical indicators while its latest quarterly revenue missed market expectations. The company's revenue declined by 10.6% year-over-year, coming in at $2.20 billion against a $2.28 billion consensus, though profitability metrics like net margin and return on equity remain steady. While technical analysis shows bullish signals, and analysts maintain a cautious but optimistic outlook with a median price target of $78.77, institutional selling and future sales trajectory will be key for the stock's performance.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
