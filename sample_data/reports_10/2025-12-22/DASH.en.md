- Fox Advisors downgraded Maplebear (NASDAQ:CART), parent company of Instacart, from a "strong-buy" to a "hold" rating, citing ongoing regulatory scrutiny over its AI pricing tool and recent insider stock sales. This downgrade contributes to a mixed analyst consensus of "Moderate Buy" with an average target price of $52.21, despite the company's recent earnings beat and revenue growth. The $60 million FTC settlement for deceptive practices has removed one legal overhang, but the ongoing probe into its Eversight AI pricing tool remains a significant risk.

The focus is on whether off-premise sales, now 21% of revenue, and menu innovation can offset dining pressures and maintain growth despite investor concerns about leverage.
