### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|

| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
