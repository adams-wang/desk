- Two major rail unions representing over half of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern's workers now oppose the proposed $85 billion merger, citing concerns about increased safety risks, higher shipping rates and consumer prices, and significant disruptions. This opposition adds to criticism from other groups and BNSF, while the merger still has support from the largest rail union, some shippers, and President Donald Trump. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board will review the deal under stringent standards, as opponents argue it would create a monopoly and negatively impact competition and small towns.
