**5. Documents Show Houston Oil Giant SLB Aiding Russian Oil Production Despite US Sanctions**
- Source: Kyiv Post | 20251229T103004 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Documents obtained by analytics firm Dallas indicate that Houston-based energy giant SLB (formerly Schlumberger) continued transferring proprietary drilling technology to Russian manufacturers as recently as February 2025, weeks after new US sanctions targeting Russia's oil sector took effect. This activity, including detailed engineering drawings for critical oil extraction equipment components, raises concerns that SLB is undermining US sanctions and supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine. Despite having promised to exit the Russian market years earlier, SLB's continued presence and deepening involvement suggest a long-term strategy rather than a withdrawal.
