- Oracle (ORCL) shares slipped on Wednesday despite Jefferies reiterating a Buy rating and a $400 price target, as investors weigh the company's AI-driven cloud growth prospects and upcoming economic data. The stock's performance is tied to its ability to convert signed cloud contracts into revenue and the broader macroeconomic environment, particularly ahead of Friday's U.S. payrolls report and Oracle's dividend record date. Jefferies highlights Oracle as a top large-cap pick, expecting meaningful AI revenue by fiscal 2027, despite concerns about investment costs and project delays.

**3. Investment firm Jefferies names Oracle a top pick amid rising AI infrastructure demand**
- Source: https://www.varindia.com/ | 20260107T090955 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Jefferies has reiterated its 'Buy' rating for Oracle, setting a $400 price target due to the company's strong potential in AI-driven data center expansion and its TikTok USDS partnership. Despite some investor concerns about funding rapid growth, Jefferies believes Oracle's aggressive expansion could position it as a key AI workload provider, making its risk/reward profile attractive. Oracle's shares have already risen over 17% in the past year, reflecting optimism for its AI initiatives.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
