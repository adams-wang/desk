- Source: Sahm | 20251203T130913 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Insiders at Lennox International Inc. have been selling significant stakes in the company over the past year, which could be a bearish signal for investors. While a large sale by an Independent Director occurred at a price above the current market, recent selling by the Chairman of the Board, Todd Teske, totaling US$295k, alongside no insider purchases, suggests caution. Despite high insider ownership, the lack of insider buying and recent selling warrant careful consideration for potential investors.

Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
