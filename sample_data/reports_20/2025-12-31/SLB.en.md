PEG ratio 32.13 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 13.0x stretched relative to 2% growth. Balance sheet: $1.2B free cash flow. Analyst sentiment positive (5 raises, avg +9%). Insider selling cluster ($3.9M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

Volume at 52% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -SUL (Resistance).

- **Stop Loss:** $36.61 (4.6% risk)
- **Target:** $40.13 (R:R method)

### Position Sizing

- **Shares:** 681
- **Position Value:** $26,129.97
- **Portfolio %:** 26.13%

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
