- Diamond Hill Capital's Mid-Cap Strategy sold its position in Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) during the third quarter of 2025 due to concerns over slowing revenue growth and management's execution. The investment management company highlighted that the financial services technology company showed little progress in improving free cash flow conversion and its longer-term growth prospects in a changing banking technology environment became questionable. Despite Fidelity National Information Services being held by 57 hedge funds, Diamond Hill's conviction lies in more promising AI stocks with higher return potential.
