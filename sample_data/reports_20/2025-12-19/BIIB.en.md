- Biogen's stock rose 2.8% after RBC Capital reiterated an "Outperform" rating and a $210 price target, naming it a top large-cap pick for 2026. The positive outlook is based on the stabilization of Biogen's main business, expected growth for its Alzheimer's drug Leqembi, and the upcoming clinical trials for a new multiple sclerosis drug candidate, BIIB145. Shares cooled slightly to $173.47 but remained up 2.1% from the previous close, reflecting the market's meaningful reaction to this news.

- RBC Capital has reiterated an Outperform rating and $210 price target for Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), naming it a top large-cap pick for 2026 due to stabilization in its base business and expected growth from Leqembi. The firm also highlighted Biogen's expanding immunology and inflammation portfolio, which includes the early-stage BTK degrader BIIB145 for multiple sclerosis, and suggested significant upside potential linked to upcoming Eli Lilly Alzheimer's data. Biogen also recently announced collaborations and promising data for other treatments, despite a recent downgrade by HSBC due to royalty stream concerns.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T204938 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Biogen's stock has seen choppy performance recently but is up 14.3% year-to-date, driven by renewed interest in its neurology pipeline. Despite ongoing pressures, Simply Wall St's analysis suggests Biogen is significantly undervalued: a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model indicates a 53.2% undervaluation, and its Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio also signals it's mispriced compared to peers and its proprietary fair ratio. The article encourages investors to develop their own "Narratives" to assess Biogen's future value.

- BMO Capital Markets has increased its price target for Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) to $165.00 from $150.00, while maintaining a "market perform" rating. Despite mixed analyst sentiment and an average "Hold" consensus rating with a price target of $183.08, Biogen's fundamentals remain strong, with recent earnings beating estimates and a solid FY2025 guidance. The stock closed at $169.91 on Thursday, indicating BMO Capital Markets' new target suggests a slight potential downside.

**5. Biogen’s CIO is betting on a tech and AI overhaul to ‘pave the highways’ toward growth**

This overhaul involves redesigning core processes in R&D, manufacturing, and patient services to ensure Biogen's infrastructure can support its ambitious growth strategy.
