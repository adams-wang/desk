- Broadcom (AVGO) stock is experiencing a paradox: blockbuster AI-driven growth is leading to margin pressure concerns, causing the stock to pull back from recent highs despite strong fundamentals. Wall Street analysts continue to issue bullish price targets, and the broader AI market sentiment is stabilizing, suggesting that the recent sell-off might be more related to an "AI expectations reset" than a company-specific issue. Investors are closely watching the conversion of its $73 billion AI backlog and the ongoing impact of the VMware acquisition on long-term cash flows versus potential regulatory and customer backlash.

However, concerns about "AI financing" risks and the lingering "margin vs. growth" debate post-earnings continue to create volatility. Investors are watching for triple witching, economic data releases, and broader AI sector performance leading into Friday's open, along with the release of the company's 10-K report.
