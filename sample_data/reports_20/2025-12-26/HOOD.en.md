3. Heavy insider selling: $64M sold (23 transactions in 90 days).
4. Near-term weakness: 7.7% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -2.6% to -6.4% (-3.8% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 10.4pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis).
