  "cycle_reasoning": "Only 1 sector (XLV Healthcare) shows clear bullish trend signal in Zone A, while 7 sectors remain in toxic/avoid territory.

  "rotation_analysis": "Current rotation shows extreme concentration with only Healthcare demonstrating sustained trend strength, while 7 of 11 sectors languish in toxic/avoid territory. This is NOT a healthy rotation pattern for EARLY_EXPANSION classification. The data suggests a defensive rotation within a NORMAL regime rather than classic early-cycle behavior where cyclicals (XLI, XLB, XLF) would lead. Instead, we see: (1) Healthcare leading as defensive quality, (2) Technology/Financials/Energy treading water in noise range, (3) Materials/Industrials weakening despite positive fundamentals (defense contracts, F-35 deliveries), and (4) Rate-sensitive sectors (Utilities -2.80%, Staples -2.71%, REITs -1.41%) experiencing severe capital outflows. The elevated put/call ratio (1.12) from L1 aligns with this cautious positioning. Rotation velocity is LOW (stable trends) but only because most sectors are stably underperforming. Key insight: This is a 'flight to quality' rotation where investors are consolidating into Healthcare while avoiding both cyclicals and traditional defensives, suggesting uncertainty about economic trajectory despite NORMAL regime classification.",
  "l1_alignment": "Partial alignment with tension points. L1 indicates NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias (100% position size), suggesting risk-on conditions with VIX at 15.38 and positive yield curve (+62bps). However, L2 sector rotation shows defensive behavior with Healthcare leading and 7 sectors in toxic zones. The elevated put/call ratio (1.12) from L1 explains this disconnect - investors are hedging despite stable macro conditions. The AGGRESSIVE bias from L1 should favor cyclicals (XLI, XLB, XLE), but these are weakening or neutral, indicating sector-level caution overriding macro greenlight. Breadth at 59.5% is healthy but not exceptional, supporting the mixed rotation picture. Resolution: L1's NORMAL/AGGRESSIVE regime provides permission for risk-taking, but L2 rotation shows investors are selective, favoring defensive quality (XLV) over cyclical exposure. This suggests late-stage NORMAL regime where participants are cautious despite stable conditions, positioning for potential regime shift.",
  "key_insight": "Healthcare is the only sector showing sustained trend strength in an otherwise fragmented market where 7 of 11 sectors are in toxic territory - this extreme concentration signals a 'flight to defensive quality' rotation that contradicts the AGGRESSIVE bias from L1's NORMAL regime, suggesting investors are hedging macro stability with sector-level caution and positioning for potential regime transition.",
  "markdown_report": "",
  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (LOW confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 regime: NORMAL (STABLE) with AGGRESSIVE bias, 100% position size max. VIX 15.38 (18th percentile), yield curve +62bps positive, breadth 59.5% healthy. However, put/call 1.12 elevated suggests hedging activity. No hard blocks from L1. Macro supports risk-taking but sector rotation shows defensive behavior - potential conflict requiring resolution in Step 4.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nPre-calculated signals validated against v7.0 thresholds: XLV (Zone A, MRS_20=+2.25%, MRS_5=+1.15%) correctly assigned TREND with 1.2x modifier. XLK/XLF/XLE (Zone E) correctly NEUTRAL with 1.0x. XLB/XLI (Zone B, MRS_5 negative) correctly WEAKENING with 0.75x. XLY/XLC/XLRE/XLP/XLU (Zone C, MRS_20 < -0.5%) correctly AVOID with 0.5x. No anomalies detected. Signal distribution: 1 TREND, 3 NEUTRAL, 2 WEAKENING, 5 AVOID aligns with zone placements and S/V/A thresholds.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: Zone A (1 sector: XLV Healthcare leading), Zone E (3 sectors: XLK/XLF/XLE in noise range showing indecision), Zone B (2 sectors: XLB/XLI weakening from prior strength), Zone C (5 sectors: XLY/XLC/XLRE/XLP/XLU toxic with deep underperformance). Rotation direction: DEFENSIVE - only Healthcare (defensive) in bullish zone, cyclicals (XLI/XLB) weakening, rate-sensitive defensives (XLU/XLP) toxic. This is NOT offensive rotation despite L1 AGGRESSIVE bias. Extreme concentration in single defensive sector indicates narrow leadership and market uncertainty.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nCONFLICT: L1 AGGRESSIVE bias (NORMAL regime, 100% size) vs L2 DEFENSIVE rotation (Healthcare only leader, cyclicals weak). RESOLUTION: L1's elevated put/call (1.12) and modest breadth (59.5%) explain cautious sector behavior. Macro is stable but not euphoric. Investors are taking L1's permission for risk but expressing it selectively through defensive quality (Healthcare) rather than cyclical leverage. News context supports: AI infrastructure themes (XLC +0.248 sentiment, XLRE +0.294) show bullish narratives but weak price action, suggesting profit-taking or valuation concerns. Healthcare benefits from rotation to quality and undervalued pharma themes. Recommendation: Respect L2 defensive rotation within L1's NORMAL framework - favor XLV, use 100% size but concentrate in quality rather than broad cyclical exposure until sector leadership broadens.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nOnly 1 sector (XLV Healthcare) shows clear bullish trend signal in Zone A, while 7 sectors remain in toxic/avoid territory. This pattern shows minimal sector leadership consistency, warranting LOW confidence. The classification as EARLY_EXPANSION is tentative given Healthcare's defensive nature leading in isolation, without typical early-cycle cyclical participation from Industrials, Materials, or Financials.\n\nKey Insight: Healthcare is the only sector showing sustained trend strength in an otherwise fragmented market where 7 of 11 sectors are in toxic territory - this extreme concentration signals a 'flight to defensive quality' rotation that contradicts the AGGRESSIVE bias from L1's NORMAL regime, suggesting investors are hedging macro stability with sector-level caution and positioning for potential regime transition."
