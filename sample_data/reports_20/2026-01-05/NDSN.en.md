- SPX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:SPXC) has a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45.3x, significantly higher than the average U.S. market P/E of 19x. This P/E is justified by the company's strong recent earnings growth, including a 24% gain in the last year and 316% over three years, alongside analyst forecasts predicting an 18% annual EPS growth over the next three years, outpacing the market's 11%.

**4. Gates Industrial Corporation plc's (NYSE:GTES) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 30% Above Its Share Price**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T100931 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 64%
- A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model suggests that Gates Industrial Corporation plc (NYSE:GTES) is undervalued by approximately 23%, with a fair value of US$28.76 compared to its current share price of US$22.06. The analysis projects future cash flows over two stages, accounting for varying growth rates and discounting them back to present value using a 9.4% cost of equity. While the DCF model indicates potential upside, it's crucial for investors to consider other factors like industry cyclicality, future capital requirements, and identified risks alongside this valuation.
