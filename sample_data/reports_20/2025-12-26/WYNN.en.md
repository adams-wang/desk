**3. Did Doubling MGM China’s Brand Fees Just Shift MGM Resorts International's (MGM) Investment Narrative?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251225T050852 | Neutral | Relevance: 59%
- MGM Resorts International has doubled its monthly brand licensing fees with MGM China to 3.5% of adjusted net revenues, securing a more predictable income stream until 2032. This move supports MGM Resorts' investment narrative by bolstering recurring revenue amidst its significant capital commitments, such as the Osaka integrated resort. While the increased fees offer some stability, the company's short-term performance remains largely dependent on premium gaming demand and project returns.
