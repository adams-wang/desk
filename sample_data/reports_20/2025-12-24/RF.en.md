**5. Comerica-Fifth Third deal’s speed attacked by investor HoldCo**
- Source: Banking Dive | 20251223T180918 | Neutral | Relevance: 64%
- Activist investor HoldCo is intensifying its efforts to block Fifth Third's $10.9 billion acquisition of Comerica, arguing the deal was rushed and driven by Comerica CEO Curt Farmer's personal interests rather than shareholder value. HoldCo points to the unusually short 17-day timeline for the deal's execution, contrasting it with other recent bank mergers, and highlights supplemental disclosures suggesting the timing aimed to neutralize a proxy contest. Despite proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommending approval due to reasonable valuation and lack of competing offers, HoldCo maintains that Farmer's significant compensation package in the merger indicates a conflict of interest.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
