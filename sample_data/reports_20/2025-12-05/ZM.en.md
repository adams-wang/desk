3. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.8x requires aggressive growth execution.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 5 raises (avg +7%) could attract flows.
- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +1.4% over 5 days suggests accumulation.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.83 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (margin 33%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (4.4x), low leverage (D/E 0.23). Analyst sentiment positive (5 raises, avg +7%). Insider selling cluster ($25.6M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 3 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from 1.4% to 2.8% (+1.4% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 1.2pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis).

MACD histogram positive (0.56), confirming momentum. Volume at 58% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +SUL (Resistance test).

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX near 15th percentile of 52-week range signals calm conditions, while modest yield curve steepening (54bps 10Y-3M) suggests healthy growth expectations. Breadth at 52% indicates selective participation rather than broad-based momentum.*
