**4. It turns out Saudi Arabia will own 93.4 percent of EA if the buyout goes through, which is effectively all of it**

- Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is set to own 93.4% of Electronic Arts (EA) if its $55 billion leveraged buyout, announced in October, goes through. This massive stake makes other investors in the consortium, such as Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners and Silver Lake, effectively insignificant, especially since PIF is also a significant investor in them. The deal's details, revealed through a filing with Brazil's antitrust regulator, indicate that the PIF will fund a substantial portion of the acquisition, raising questions about EA's previously stated commitment to unchanging values.

**5. Saudi Arabia's PIF will own over 93.4% of EA if the deal completes**

- Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) is set to own over 93.4% of Electronic Arts if its acquisition is successful, according to a filing with the Brazilian anti-trust regulator. The PIF is also a significant investor in Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the other members of the consortium acquiring EA, effectively giving the PIF outright ownership. The $55 billion deal, announced in September, is expected to close in Q1 of EA's 2027 fiscal year, with current CEO Andrew Wilson staying on.
