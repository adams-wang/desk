**1. Does Western Gateway Pipeline Access to Los Angeles Change The Bull Case For Phillips 66 (PSX)?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260104T225015 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 87%
- Phillips 66 and Kinder Morgan's Western Gateway pipeline project will connect Midwestern refinery output to high-demand markets including Los Angeles, potentially reshaping regional fuel supply. While this expansion reinforces Phillips 66's logistics focus, it does not significantly alter the near-term earnings risks associated with refining volatility and upcoming refinery closures. The overall investment narrative for Phillips 66 still heavily relies on improving cash generation and reliability from its midstream and refining assets.
