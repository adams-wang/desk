- The FDA has proactively granted Johnson & Johnson a National Priority Review Voucher for its Tecvayli and Darzalex combination for multiple myeloma, aiming for a decision within one to two months. This follows "unprecedented" Phase 3 MajesTEC-3 trial results showing a 54% reduction in death risk and 83% progression-free survival advantage over traditional regimens. The voucher, one of 16 issued under the pilot program, reflects the FDA's commitment to swiftly advancing treatments with outstanding results.

- A California jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $40 million to two women who argued its talc-based baby powder caused their ovarian cancer after decades of use. J&J plans to appeal the verdict, asserting its products are safe and that the ruling lacks evidence. The company faces over 67,000 similar lawsuits despite discontinuing talc-based baby powder sales in the U.S. in 2020.

- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stock is trading near record highs, closing Thursday at an all-time high of $210.01. Analysts are actively recalibrating price targets, with Wells Fargo raising its target to $230 and Morgan Stanley to $197, reflecting a valuation debate. The company's momentum is driven by strong Q3 2025 earnings, a raised sales outlook, a planned orthopaedics spin-off, and positive late-stage clinical data in oncology and hematology, despite ongoing talc litigation and policy uncertainties.

**4. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock on December 10, 2025: Pipeline Breakthroughs, Talc Risks and What Analysts Expect Next**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251210T180758 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) stock is trading near record highs, driven by strong growth in oncology and immunology, especially new data on its multiple myeloma treatments Tecvayli and Carvykti, and the potential blockbuster drug icotrokinra. However, the company faces significant challenges from ongoing talc litigation, with over 90,000 lawsuits and no global settlement in sight. Analysts have a "Moderate Buy" consensus, with price targets close to current trading levels, while some valuation models suggest the stock is still undervalued despite its 2025 rally.

**5. J&J’s $1.7 billion bet on Israeli heart device falters after FDA panel vote**
- Source: CTech | 20251210T084136 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of Israeli heart-device maker V-Wave, valued at up to $1.7 billion, is in jeopardy after an FDA advisory panel unanimously voted against the effectiveness and risk-benefit of V-Wave's Ventura Interatrial Shunt System. The acquisition's full value, with $1.1 billion contingent on regulatory approval, is now uncertain as the FDA typically follows such recommendations, potentially limiting the device's market or requiring further trials. This outcome impacts J&J's strategy to offset future revenue loss from other blockbuster drugs.
