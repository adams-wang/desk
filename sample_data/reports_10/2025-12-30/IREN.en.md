- Iris Energy (IREN) shares declined by 5.5% on Friday, closing at $40.30, following an approximate 9% gain the prior week. The company is strategically shifting from a Bitcoin miner to an AI infrastructure provider, securing new multi-year contracts that are expected to generate over $500 million in annual recurring revenue by early 2026. While some analysts maintain a bullish outlook due to the company's power capacity and data center sites, others express caution regarding its rapid valuation expansion.

### Key Risks

1. High beta (4.24) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (16.0%, 1.3 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
4. Near-term weakness: 23.1% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.
5. Falling knife pattern: rapid decline without stabilization, catch risk elevated.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
