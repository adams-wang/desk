**5. Oklo's Drop Makes Sense, But So Does Buying the Dip**

- Oklo (OKLO), a nuclear power company, experienced a selloff after announcing a $1.5 billion At-The-Market (ATM) equity raise, which investors often perceive negatively due to dilution concerns. However, the author argues this is a market overreaction, as raising equity when a stock is elevated is a prudent move for capital-intensive businesses like Oklo, especially given the growing demand for electricity and the positive political outlook for nuclear power. Despite the immediate drop, the long-term benefits and current market valuation suggest it could be a buying opportunity, though caution is advised.
