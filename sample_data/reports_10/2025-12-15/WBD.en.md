The situation is complicated by increasing antitrust scrutiny from regulators and politicians, alongside a consumer lawsuit, leading to WBD's stock performance being driven by deal probabilities and regulatory risk rather than traditional financials. Investors are now watching WBD's formal response to Paramount's offer and the ongoing regulatory developments concerning the Netflix transaction.

Paramount's bid is for the entire company, including CNN, while Netflix aims for only the studio and streaming divisions. The expert suggests that even with differing market shares and acquisition scopes, regulators will scrutinize both deals closely, focusing particularly on the streaming market, and the approval process could take one to two years.
