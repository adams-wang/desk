**1. GitLab Q3 2025 Earnings: Revenue Beat vs. Retention & Public Sector Challenges - News and Statistics**
- Source: IndexBox | 20251210T080915 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- GitLab exceeded Q3 2025 revenue and adjusted profit expectations, but market reaction was negative due to a slowdown in net revenue retention and public sector challenges. The company reported $244.4 million in revenue, a 24.6% year-on-year increase, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.25. Despite raising full-year adjusted EPS guidance, concerns remain regarding government decision-making slowdowns and the need for new customer acquisition strategies.
