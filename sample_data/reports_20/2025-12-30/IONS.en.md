**1. Revenues Not Telling The Story For Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:IONS)**
- Source: 富途牛牛 | 20251229T200846 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of 13.4x is currently in line with the Biotech industry median, despite the company's recent revenue growth being less than most peers and its future revenue forecast being weaker. Analysts predict 20% annual revenue growth for Ionis over the next three years, significantly below the industry's projected 120% growth. This discrepancy suggests investors might be overvaluing the stock, potentially leading to future disappointment if the P/S ratio adjusts to better reflect its growth outlook.
