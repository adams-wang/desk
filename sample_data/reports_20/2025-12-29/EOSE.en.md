### Key Risks

2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-8.3% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. High short interest (26.2%, 3.8 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
4. Near-term weakness: 21.3% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -8.5% to -16.7% (-8.3% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 20.7pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -16.4% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 17.5pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.34x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). Volume at 57% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -SUL (Resistance).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
