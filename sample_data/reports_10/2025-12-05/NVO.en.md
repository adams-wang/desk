**1. Details of failed studies cast pall on Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 as Alzheimer's treatment**
- Source: Yahoo News Canada | 20251204T030800 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Two large trials of Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 drug semaglutide, sold as Rybelsus, showed no cognitive benefit for people with early Alzheimer's disease, disappointing hopes for its use as a treatment. While the drug showed some improvement in biological measures and suppressed inflammation, it did not delay cognitive decline. Experts suggest further research into semaglutide's use for amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease is unlikely.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with stabilizing volatility and moderate risk appetite. Fed in data-dependent mode with 7 days to FOMC—soft economic data (retail -4.67% MoM, CPI 2.89% rising) offsetting labor resilience. AI infrastructure demand and capital reallocation themes dominating corporate narratives, signaling selective risk-on in growth/tech segments. Narrow breadth (52% above 50MA) and neutral put/call suggest complacency but not excess—standard late-cycle positioning amid policy uncertainty.*
