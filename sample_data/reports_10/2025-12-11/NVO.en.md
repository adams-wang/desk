- Structure Therapeutics (GPCR) shares surged over 102% after its mid-stage obesity pill trial results outperformed rival offerings from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

-  Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk has again approached the Delhi High Court, this time seeking to prevent Sun Pharmaceutical from dealing in semaglutide, the active ingredient in its blockbuster weight-loss drug Ozempic. This move follows a recent court decision allowing Dr. Reddy's Laboratories to manufacture and export its semaglutide-based drug, though it is barred from selling it in India until Novo Nordisk's patent expires. The case has been transferred to the same court handling the previous Dr. Reddy's suit for a consolidated hearing.

-  Novo Nordisk has completed its acquisition of Akero Therapeutics for $54 per share in cash, plus a Contingent Value Right (CVR) of an additional $6 per share upon US regulatory approval of Akero's lead candidate, EFX. Akero is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Novo Nordisk, and its common stock will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Akero Therapeutics focuses on treatments for serious metabolic diseases, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), with its lead candidate efruxifermin (EFX) currently in Phase 3 clinical studies.

However, the article raises questions about the sustainability of this rally in a competitive pharmaceutical landscape.
