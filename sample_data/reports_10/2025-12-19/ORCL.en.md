**1. Oracle’s stock is rising. Why TikTok’s U.S. deal could be good news for the tech company.**
- Source: MarketWatch | 20251218T182800 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Oracle's stock jumped 5% after hours following reports that TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, signed deals to create a U.S. joint venture. This venture would be majority-owned by U.S. companies, with Oracle serving as a "key" customer for its cloud unit, according to an internal memo from TikTok's CEO. The agreements also reportedly include tech investment firm Silver Lake and MGX.

**2. Why Oracle keeps sparking AI-bubble fears**
- Source: Axios | 20251218T110838 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Oracle's stock tumble and concerns over a planned data center investment have intensified fears regarding the AI boom. Investors are becoming wary of potential delays in AI profits, especially for companies heavily investing in infrastructure without immediate application-based returns. This recalibration of risk, particularly affecting companies like Oracle and CoreWeave, suggests the market is becoming more rational about the sustainability of the AI bubble.

**3. Oracle’s AI Expansion Hits Snag As Key Investor Pulls Back: Report**
- Source: Stocktwits | 20251217T140811 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Oracle faces a setback in its AI data center expansion as Blue Owl Capital, a major funding partner, withdrew from a $10 billion investment for a new facility. The withdrawal is due to concerns over Oracle's rising debt and rapid spending on AI infrastructure, leaving the project's financing in limbo. This highlights pressure on Oracle's AI strategy, as the company's debt has grown to $105 billion, and its debt-to-equity ratio stands at 4.3.

**4. Oracle’s stock falls on a fear one analyst says should be ‘almost irrelevant’**
- Source: MarketWatch | 20251217T124900 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Oracle's stock experienced a decline after the Financial Times reported that its primary data-center partner, Blue Owl Capital, would not fund its $10 billion Michigan data center. Despite this, some Wall Street experts believe the selloff is an overreaction.

**5. Oracle: Recent Stock Performance Likely an Overreaction to Potential Risks**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251218T190917 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Morningstar believes Oracle's recent stock decline of over 45% is an overreaction to artificial intelligence investment risks, despite acknowledging setbacks in data center expansion and a higher cost of debt. The firm has trimmed its fair value estimate for Oracle to $277 per share from $286 and raised its Uncertainty Rating to Very High, yet continues to view shares as undervalued due to ample demand for AI-related data centers.
