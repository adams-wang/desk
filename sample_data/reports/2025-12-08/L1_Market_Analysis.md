**Conflicts & Divergences**

- Upgrade: Breadth expansion above 55% signaling broader participation, VIX sustained below 15 with improving breadth, Fed dovish pivot signals ahead of January FOMC
- Downgrade: VIX break above 20 with deteriorating breadth, Breadth collapse below 40% indicating risk-off rotation, Yield curve inversion below 0bps

**Risk Factors**
