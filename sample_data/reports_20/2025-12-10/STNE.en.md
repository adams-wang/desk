### Key Risks

1. High beta (1.85) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-2.3% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Near-term weakness: 13.9% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -6.1% to -8.4% (-2.3% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 12.4pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -6.2% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 9.8pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.01x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). Volume at 54% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
