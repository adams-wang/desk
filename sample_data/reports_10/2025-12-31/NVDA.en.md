**1. Nvidia, TSMC rise as the world’s most valuable company reportedly asks for more chips to meet Chinese demand**
- Source: Sherwood News | 20251231T130817 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Nvidia and TSMC are experiencing a premarket surge following reports that Nvidia requested TSMC to increase production of its H200 AI chips to meet significant Chinese demand. This comes after news that Nvidia will ship its top-performing Hopper generation processors to China, with Chinese companies reportedly placing orders for over 2 million chips for 2026. The ability to fulfill this demand, which could provide a $54 billion revenue boost for Nvidia, is contingent on Chinese regulatory approval.

**2. NVIDIA Corporation $NVDA is Munro Partners' Largest Position**
- Source: MarketBeat | 20251231T102002 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Munro Partners has trimmed its NVIDIA (NVDA) stake by 20.6% in Q3, yet NVIDIA remains its largest holding, valued at approximately $298.2 million. The company reported strong earnings and receives largely bullish analyst ratings, with an average price target of $262.14, despite recent heavy insider selling and strategic capital deployment risks. NVIDIA recently announced a quarterly dividend and continues to be a focus for analysts due to its AI power-play and strategic acquisitions.

**3. Exclusive | ByteDance to pour US$14 billion into Nvidia chips in 2026 as AI demand surges**
- Source: South China Morning Post | 20251231T090000 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- ByteDance plans to spend an estimated US$14 billion on Nvidia AI chips in 2026, a substantial increase from its 2025 budget, contingent on the US allowing sales of its H200 graphic processing units in China. The company is also developing its own AI chips through a design unit and investing in memory technologies. This move highlights ByteDance's growing computing needs across its various platforms and AI initiatives.

**4. Nvidia’s Groq bet shows that the economics of AI chip-building are still unsettled**
- Source: Fortune | 20251230T180757 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Nvidia made a significant bet on Groq, a startup specializing in AI inference chips, by licensing its technology and hiring its team. This move suggests that even though Nvidia built its AI empire on GPUs, it acknowledges that the economics of AI inference are still developing and may require specialized hardware beyond GPUs to dominate this critical phase of AI. The company aims to corner the inference market, which CEO Jensen Huang predicts will grow exponentially and drive AI’s "industrial revolution."

**5. Nvidia finalizes its roughly 4%, $5 billion stake in Intel**
- Source: Quartz | 20251230T020813 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 99%
- Nvidia has finalized its approximately 4%, $5 billion stake in Intel, purchasing 214.8 million shares at $23.28 each. This deal, announced in September, makes Nvidia a significant shareholder in Intel and is seen as a strategic move to facilitate an x86-friendly path into Nvidia’s AI infrastructure. Both companies emphasize it as a "historic partnership" to develop products for data centers and PCs, focusing on influence and distribution rather than manufacturing changes for Nvidia's core products.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
