- Tesla's shares fell by 5% following Nvidia's announcement at CES 2026 to develop and sell an autonomous driving system for personal vehicles and robotaxis. This new competition is seen as a threat to Tesla's growth in the autonomous driving software market, potentially impacting its future robotaxi service and overall market share. Morningstar maintains its $300 fair value estimate for Tesla, considering the stock overvalued at current prices.

- Tesla shares fell after Nvidia's CEO presented new self-driving technology at CES, raising concerns about increased competition in the robo-taxi market. Nvidia's Alpamayo system, which offers deep reasoning for autonomous vehicles, will be integrated into Mercedes' CLA models this year.

- Tesla's Shanghai plant shipments decreased by 7% in 2025, marking its second consecutive annual decline, indicating increased competition and cooling demand in China's EV market. The company exported 851,732 cars from Shanghai, a significant drop from its 2023 peak. Globally, Tesla's deliveries also fell by 9% in 2025, and Chinese competitor BYD surpassed Tesla as the top EV producer.

- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20260105T160855 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Tesla's stock (TSLA) surged over 4% today despite soft delivery figures, driven by record energy storage deployments and accelerating progress in robotaxi testing and Full Self-Driving technology. Analysts are increasingly valuing Tesla not just as a car company, but as an artificial intelligence and autonomy play, with robotaxi and AI initiatives becoming critical drivers of future value. The company's energy business and autonomous vehicle milestones are shifting investor focus and expectations for long-term growth.

**5. Tesla stock forms a rare bullish pattern as it faces a double whammy**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20260105T160849 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Tesla stock has recently dropped, reaching a low of $438, as the company faces a double whammy of slowing sales and high valuation metrics. Despite a rare bullish "inverse head-and-shoulders" pattern forming, indicating a potential short-term rebound to $500, analysts remain concerned about the long-term downtrend due to valuation issues. The company's future hinges on its AI and robotics ventures, which are considered years away from profitability.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
