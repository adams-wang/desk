## Sector Analysis

### Executive Summary
Cycle phase: MID_EXPANSION (MEDIUM confidence). Rotation bias: NEUTRAL. Key insight: Extreme sector concentration with Technology as the sole outperformer creates a fragile market structure that contradicts the NORMAL macro regime's typical broad participation, signaling potential late-cycle dynamics emerging despite mid-expansion classification.

### Market Narrative
- Technology: AI infrastructure demand, semiconductor strength, cloud computing growth.
- Weakness in Energy, Consumer Defensive, Financial Services: Oil price volatility, OPEC+ production concerns, renewable energy transition; Consumer spending pressure, margin compression, inventory challenges.

### Rotation Summary
The current rotation pattern reveals an extremely narrow market with Technology as the sole outperformer, creating a concerning divergence from the NORMAL macro regime. With 7 sectors in AVOID status and 2 in TOXIC territory, this represents significant breadth deterioration. The concentration in XLK (+1.28% MRS_20) while traditional cyclicals like Industrials (-1.48%) and Financials (-1.01%) underperform suggests investors are seeking growth quality over cyclical leverage. The defensive sectors' poor performance (XLP at -2.01%, XLU at -5.38%) indicates this isn't a flight-to-safety rotation but rather a narrow growth-focused positioning.
