- Ford reported a 61% crash in all-electric vehicle sales for November, a significant drop attributed to the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. This collapse serves as a warning for the entire EV industry, including Tesla (TSLA), whose Q3 sales were also boosted by the expiring tax credit.

**5. Over 20,000 Ford vehicles recalled due to battery issue. See impacted models.**
- Source: USA Today | 20251202T035353 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Ford is recalling over 20,000 vehicles, including 2021-2024 Lincoln Corsair plug-in hybrids and 2020-2024 Ford Escape PHEVs, due to a battery issue that could lead to fires or crashes. The problem stems from high-voltage battery cells that may experience internal short-circuiting, causing the propulsion system to shut down and potentially resulting in battery thermal venting. Ford has not determined the exact cause but suggests previous damage to the battery pack cell's separator layer, and is recommending customers limit charging and use "Auto EV" mode until a free remedy is provided.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
