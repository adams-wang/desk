### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 3 raises (avg +17%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 3.05 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 27.3x stretched relative to 9% growth. Quality metrics strong (ROE 23%, ROA 13%, margin 20%). Balance sheet: low leverage (D/E 0.40). Analyst sentiment positive (3 raises, avg +17%). Insider selling cluster ($3.5M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (4 buying vs 5 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 weakening modestly (-0.7% over 5 days). Below STRENGTH zone by 2.7pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 at 0.7% confirms short-term momentum alignment. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). MACD histogram bearish (-0.74), momentum weakening. RSI overbought at 70, risk of mean reversion. Volume at 40% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +SBL (Volatile).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
