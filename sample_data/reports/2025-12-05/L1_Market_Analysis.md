**Conflicts & Divergences**
- VIX very calm (15th percentile) while put/call ratio elevated at 1.038 suggests underlying hedging activity

**Positioning Guidance**
- Regime: NORMAL (STABLE)
- Confidence: MEDIUM
- Position size: 100% max
- Key action: Maintain current positioning with selective focus on quality names, as calm volatility supports risk-taking but narrow breadth warrants caution on broad exposure.

- Downgrade: VIX spike above 22 with breadth falling below 45%, Put/call ratio sustained above 1.2 indicating fear building

**Risk Factors**
- Narrow market breadth at 52% suggests fragile rally dependent on few names
- Elevated put/call ratio (1.038) indicates smart money hedging despite calm VIX
- Next FOMC 42 days away creates policy uncertainty vacuum
- Year-end positioning effects may amplify volatility in thin December trading
