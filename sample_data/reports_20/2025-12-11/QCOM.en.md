- Source: Stocktwits | 20251211T180857 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- The US Treasury Department is reportedly preparing new guidance that would enable companies like Salesforce Inc. (CRM) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) to fully utilize R&D deductions, which were previously restricted under the 15% minimum corporate tax. This move could release tens of billions of dollars in benefits for research-intensive companies and represents a further softening of the 2022 minimum corporate tax through exemptions and looser regulations. The guidance aims to resolve a conflict that arose when the minimum tax prevented companies earning over $1 billion from using retroactive R&D deductions from former President Trump's tax bill.
