- International Paper's stock is currently in a state of cautious equilibrium, neither an obvious bargain nor a strong leader, reflecting investor indecision amidst easing input costs and soft packaging demand. While the stock has shown a modest low double-digit percentage gain over the last year, including dividends, analysts widely consider it fairly to slightly undervalued, suitable for patient, income-minded investors.
