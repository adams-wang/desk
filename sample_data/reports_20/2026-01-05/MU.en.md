- Micron Technology Inc. (MU) experienced a volatile trading session, closing down about 1.2% despite early gains, as a Reuters report highlighted an "unprecedented" AI-driven memory shortage and rising prices for high-bandwidth memory (HBM). The article discusses the impact of AI demand on memory supply, with manufacturers diverting capacity to HBM, and anticipates upcoming U.S. jobs and inflation data as key catalysts for stock movement. Investors are closely watching for signals on memory contract pricing and HBM availability amidst debates about a potential "supercycle" in the memory market.

- Micron Technology Inc. (MU) shares rose, leading a memory sector rally fueled by surging AI demand. This demand has created a global supply shortage, with prices for certain memory products more than doubling since early 2025. Analysts predict this "memory supercycle" will continue until at least 2027 due to ongoing AI infrastructure spending.

- Micron Technology (MU) shares jumped 10.5% after Bernstein SocGen Group raised its price target to $330, maintaining an "outperform" rating, fueled by expectations that AI data-center buildouts will drive the next memory pricing cycle. The stock's surge follows a strong fiscal Q1 report and optimistic Q2 outlook, extending its run as a top performer in 2025 due to investor bets on AI infrastructure spending keeping memory supply tight. Investors are now looking to CES and Micron's next earnings report for further signals on memory pricing and AI demand in 2026, though analysts warn about the risk of pricing volatility if supply outpaces demand.

This rally positions Micron, a key player in memory chips and HBM for AI processors, at the forefront of a data-heavy January influenced by interest-rate expectations and upcoming economic reports.

**5. Micron Stock Hits Record High As Bernstein Sees Biggest Price Upcycle Driving Memory Boom — Retail Calls It ‘Cheap’**

- Micron Technology (MU) shares reached a record high following Bernstein's increased price target to $330, citing the largest pricing upcycle in the memory sector driven by AI-led demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM. The company reported record revenue and margin expansion in its Q1 results, with a strong outlook for Q2, while retail investors on Stocktwits expressed bullish sentiment, calling the stock "cheap" despite its significant surge over the past year. Analysts expect tight supply conditions and higher prices for DRAM and NAND to persist beyond 2026.
