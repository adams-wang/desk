- Oklo (OKLO), a nuclear power company, experienced a selloff after announcing a $1.5 billion At-The-Market (ATM) equity raise, which investors often perceive negatively due to dilution concerns. However, the author argues this is a market overreaction, as raising equity when a stock is elevated is a prudent move for capital-intensive businesses like Oklo, especially given the growing demand for electricity and the positive political outlook for nuclear power. Despite the immediate drop, the long-term benefits and current market valuation suggest it could be a buying opportunity, though caution is advised.

This move introduces dilution concerns for investors, despite overall constructive analyst ratings with wide price target dispersions. The market's reaction reflects sensitivity to potential dilution, wider AI-linked risk-off sentiment, and a wobbling "AI power" narrative surrounding nuclear energy infrastructure.
