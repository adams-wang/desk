The company now expects sequential growth of roughly 1% in sales, exceeding earlier expectations of a decline, and projects GAAP earnings per share of about $0.02 and non-GAAP earnings per share of about $0.40.

- Source: GlobeNewswire | 20251203T080900 | Bullish | Relevance: 99%
-  Microchip Technology has introduced two new digital power monitors, the PAC1711 and PAC1811, which significantly reduce the power required to measure power consumption in portable devices and energy-restricted applications. These monitors consume half the power of comparable solutions under typical operating conditions, while also offering real-time system alerts and a patent-pending step-alert function for detecting variations in power usage. This innovation allows MCUs to remain dormant until significant power events occur, leading to longer device operation under battery-conscious designs.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
