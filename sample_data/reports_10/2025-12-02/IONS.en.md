**2. Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS): Valuation Perspective Following FDA Breakthrough Therapy Milestone for Olezarsen**
- Source: Sahm | 20251202T042137 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 97%
-  Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for olezarsen, its drug candidate for severe hypertriglyceridemia, leading to a surge in its stock price and a 138% year-to-date return. While a "most popular narrative" suggests the company is 3.2% undervalued with a fair value of $85.47, driven by ambitious revenue and profit margin forecasts, an alternative view based on price-to-sales ratios (13.9x) indicates a cautious picture, as it is higher than both peer and industry averages. Investors are encouraged to create their own analysis due to the conflicting valuations and potential for market sentiment shifts.
