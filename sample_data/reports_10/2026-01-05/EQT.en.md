**1. Is EQT Corp. the Sleeper Energy Stock About to Explode?**
- Source: AD HOC NEWS | 20260105T054613 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- EQT Corp., the largest natural gas producer in the U.S., is gaining attention as a potential investment despite the focus on AI stocks. The article explores whether EQT is a "must-cop" for portfolios, highlighting its cash flow generation, debt reduction, and its role as a "bridge fuel" in the energy transition. Investors are advised to consider EQT's volatility, tied to natural gas prices, and its specific focus as a pure-play gas company.

**2. EQT stock slips as U.S. natural gas prices fall on warmer forecast — what traders watch next**

- EQT stock fell 0.3% as U.S. natural gas futures slid 2.6% due to a warmer mid-January weather forecast. This decline comes amidst record Lower 48 gas output and LNG feedgas flows in December, with traders closely monitoring the upcoming EIA weekly natural gas storage report on January 8th. The warmer forecast, which reduces heating degree days, directly impacts gas prices and producer margins, particularly for Appalachia-focused companies like EQT.

- Source: ts2.tech | 20260105T154654 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- EQT Corp shares fell about 4% as U.S. natural gas futures slid due to a warmer mid-January weather outlook, despite Bernstein raising its price target for EQT. Other gas-linked companies also experienced declines. The upcoming U.S. EIA storage report on Thursday, January 8, is anticipated to be the next significant market catalyst.

**4. Bernstein Raises EQT Price Target to $73, Maintains Outperform Rating**

- Bernstein analyst Bob Brackett increased EQT's (EQT) price target from $72.00 to $73.00, reiterating an "Outperform" rating. This adjustment comes amidst varied analyst evaluations, with other firms like Citigroup, Mizuho, and UBS also recently updating their price targets and ratings for the natural gas production company. The average one-year price target from 25 analysts currently stands at $65.03, suggesting a 21.65% upside from EQT's current price.

**5. Is EQT (EQT) Pricing Reflect Its DCF And P/E Valuation Signals?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T093719 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- EQT Corporation's current share price of US$53.46 suggests it may be undervalued, according to both Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Price-to-Earnings (P/E) analyses. The DCF model indicates a fair value of US$97.26 per share, a 45% discount from the current price, while the P/E ratio of 18.7x is below its calculated Fair Ratio of 21.3x, also implying undervaluation. Investors are encouraged to explore these valuation methods further and consider various market narratives affecting the energy producer.
