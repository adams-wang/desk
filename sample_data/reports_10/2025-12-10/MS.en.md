**3. Tesla Downgraded by Morgan Stanley on Valuation Concerns**

The firm set a $425 price target, noting that while Tesla remains strong, optimism around its non-auto businesses limits risk-reward. The updated valuation incorporates higher long-term assumptions for Full Self Driving and network services, but lowers auto valuation due to reduced volume estimates amid slower EV adoption and rising competition.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
