3. Premium valuation (P/E 55x, PEG 2.1x) vulnerable to multiple compression.
4. High short interest (36.6%, 2.6 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
5. Long-term trend broken: trading 20.9% below SMA200.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
