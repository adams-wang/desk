- The Georgia Public Service Commission unanimously approved Georgia Power's plan to generate 9,885 megawatts of new energy, primarily for large customers like data centers.

The plan, estimated to cost $16.3 billion but potentially $50-$60 billion for customers over time, intends to spread fixed costs across a broader customer base, with large users like data centers bearing a disproportionate share.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
