- S&P Global's stock has seen strong gains but is currently considered overvalued based on two valuation approaches. The Excess Returns model suggests the stock is 57.9% overvalued, with an intrinsic value of $316.55 per share.

**3. Platinum's Impressive Ascent Could Continue Through 2026**
- Source: Streetwise Reports | 20251216T070927 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 62%
- Platinum is experiencing a significant bull market, with its price rising 94% in 2025 to US$1,766 per ounce, driven by strong industrial demand, a role in green energy, and limited supply. Experts predict this ascent will continue through 2026, with forecasts reaching as high as US$2,340 per ounce, as the market faces a persistent structural deficit due to production constraints and increasing demand from sectors like hydrogen energy, alongside China's reclassification of platinum as a strategic critical mineral. Several companies, including Platinum Group Metals, Eastern Platinum, and Valterra Platinum, are poised to benefit from these favorable market dynamics.
