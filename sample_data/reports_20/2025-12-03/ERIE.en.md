- Banco Santander has completed the sale of 3,576,626 shares of Santander Bank Polska, representing 3.5% of its capital, at PLN 482.0 per share. This transaction, combined with a previously announced sale of 49% to Erste Group Bank AG, will leave Banco Santander with approximately a 9.7% stake in the Polish bank. The move is intended for proactive capital optimization, though Santander will maintain a presence in the Polish market through Santander Consumer and a strategic collaboration with Erste.
