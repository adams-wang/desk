**1. Intel, AMD investors on stock watch after Russia allegations**
- Source: Cryptopolitan | 20251210T210400 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Intel and AMD are facing class-action lawsuits in a Texas court, alleging they failed to prevent their chips from being used in Russian missile systems. The lawsuits, filed by Ukrainian citizens, claim the companies "looked the other way" as third parties resold restricted chips, violating US sanctions. Despite these serious allegations and similar issues involving Texas Instruments and Mouser Electronics (a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary), the stock prices of Intel and AMD have remained relatively steady.

**2. AMD (AMD) Stock Trades Down, Here Is Why**
- Source: Finviz | 20251211T172720 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Shares of AMD fell 3.8% due to disappointing earnings from Oracle, raising concerns about enterprise AI spending, and a US policy shift benefiting Nvidia in the China market. This has led to fears that companies with tightening budgets may opt for Nvidia over AMD. Despite the drop, AMD is up 77.8% year-to-date, though it's still below its 52-week high.

**3. Will Strong Data Center Growth Push Up AMD's Stock Higher in 2026?**
- Source: TradingView | 20251210T140743 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares have performed well due to strong demand for EPYC processors and Instinct GPUs, with the company anticipating double-digit data center revenue growth in Q4 2025 and significant CAGR for data center AI revenues. While AMD's expanding portfolio and AI footprint are positive, competition from NVIDIA, Broadcom, and Intel, along with a stretched valuation, pose near-term challenges. As a result, AMD currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

**4. AMD Stock Pops After U.S. Hints at China AI Chip Reopening**
- Source: TradingView | 20251209T110740 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- AMD shares rose after the U.S. indicated it would approve Nvidia's AI chip sales to China under a revenue-share model, sparking hopes for similar approval for AMD's MI300 processors. This potential market access could unlock significant revenue for AMD, despite a 25% fee, as investors prioritize market expansion over short-term profitability. Clarity from the Commerce Department regarding AMD's export eligibility is anticipated as the next catalyst for its stock.
