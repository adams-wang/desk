**3. The Truth About International Paper: Why Wall Street Suddenly Cares Again**
- Source: AD HOC NEWS | 20251231T050744 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- International Paper (IP) is gaining attention on Wall Street as a potential comeback story, despite its "boring" image. The company, a major player in packaging, containerboard, and pulp, is seen as a solid long-term investment due to its strong dividend and ties to the growing e-commerce sector, offering a steady climb rather than a volatile, meme-stock-like ride. While not a "viral brand," its role in the global shipping system makes it an attractive option for investors focused on passive income and stability rather than short-term hype.
