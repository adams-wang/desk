**2. Mizuho initiates AFLAC stock coverage with Underperform rating**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251215T221739 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Mizuho initiated coverage on AFLAC (NYSE:AFL) with an Underperform rating and a $104 price target, citing concerns about the insurer's top-line growth potential in both Japan and the United States.
