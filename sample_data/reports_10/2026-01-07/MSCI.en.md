- MSCI has decided not to exclude digital asset treasury companies (DATCOs) from its global indexes, providing a massive reprieve for companies like Strategy. This decision led to a sharp rise in shares of affected companies in after-hours trading. While the immediate threat of exclusion is removed, MSCI plans further review and consultation on the treatment of DAT companies, suggesting the possibility of reconsideration in the future.

- MSCI has decided against immediately excluding Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) from its index products, easing uncertainty for crypto-related equities like Strategy. The firm will, however, conduct a broader review of "non-operating companies" to potentially create new assessment criteria for index eligibility, acknowledging institutional investor concerns that some DATs resemble investment funds. Strategy's stock rallied over 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

- Strategy Inc (MSTR) shares jumped after hours after MSCI announced it would not exclude companies holding significant digital assets from its global stock indexes. This decision avoids potential forced selling by passive funds and supports MicroStrategy's strategy of bitcoin accumulation. The company recently increased its bitcoin holdings and relies on capital markets despite significant unrealized losses on digital assets.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
