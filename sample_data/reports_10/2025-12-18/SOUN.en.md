- Source: FOX40 News | 20251216T180919 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against SoundHound AI, Inc. and certain officers on behalf of investors who purchased SoundHound securities between May 10, 2024, and March 3, 2025. The lawsuit alleges that SoundHound made materially false and misleading statements regarding its business, operations, and prospects, specifically concerning material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting that impaired its ability to effectively account for corporate acquisitions like SYNQ3 and Amelia Holdings. These alleged misstatements led to an overstatement of goodwill and an inability to timely file financial reports.
