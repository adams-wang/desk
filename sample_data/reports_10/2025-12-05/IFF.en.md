-  International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (NYSE:IFF) currently has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.5x, similar to the Chemicals industry median in the United States. However, the company's revenue has been declining, shrinking by 3.0% last year and 12% over three years, while analyst forecasts suggest future growth of only 0.7% annually, significantly below the industry's projected 9.2% growth. This disparity suggests IFF might be overvalued relative to its revenue performance and growth outlook, potentially posing a risk to investors.

Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
