This collaboration aims to assess the operational feasibility of battery-electric haulage in large-scale iron ore mining and determine the necessary infrastructure for a transition to low-carbon operations.

- Bank of America Securities has identified two power generation stocks, GE Vernova (GEV) and Caterpillar (CAT), as "Buy" recommendations due to the increasing demand for off-grid power solutions for data centers. The constraints in the U.S. grid are pushing data center operators towards these solutions, which are beneficial for companies specializing in gas turbines and engines for onsite power generation. Both companies are expected to benefit significantly from this trend, though they face their own set of risks.
