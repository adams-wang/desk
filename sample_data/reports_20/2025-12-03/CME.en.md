- Veteran London stockbroker Alasdair Macleod believes that structural silver shortages are intensifying globally, leading to a potential market breaking point. He suggests that the COMEX blackout reflects deeper issues, as physical silver is being withdrawn from the market, especially by China which is reportedly banning silver exports.
