  "cycle_reasoning": "EARLY_EXPANSION classification with LOW confidence reflects the market's transitional state. While L1 macro conditions suggest improving risk appetite with VIX at 52-week lows, sector rotation patterns don't show the typical early-cycle leadership from cyclicals and growth sectors. Instead, we see broad-based momentum deterioration across multiple sectors, suggesting the expansion phase is either very early or facing structural headwinds that prevent clear directional rotation.",
  "rotation_analysis": "The rotation landscape shows a market in transition, with no clear offensive or defensive leadership emerging. Technology maintains its relative strength in the noise zone, supported by AI adoption themes and S&P 500 additions. Healthcare shows resilience despite recent weakness, buoyed by strong news sentiment around drug approvals and digital health innovations. However, previously strong sectors like Industrials, Materials, and Financials are showing early warning signs with negative 5-day momentum despite positive 20-day positioning. The defensive sectors (Utilities, Consumer Staples) are failing to attract capital despite their traditional safe-haven characteristics, while Energy and Real Estate remain in avoidance territory. This mixed rotation pattern suggests market participants are being selective rather than making broad sector bets.",
  "l1_alignment": "L1's NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias suggests risk-on conditions, but L2's NEUTRAL rotation bias reflects the reality of narrow market participation and mixed sector momentum. The disconnect indicates that while macro conditions are supportive, sector-specific factors and selectivity are dominating rotation patterns. This aligns with L1's observation of improving but narrow breadth recovery.",
  "key_insight": "Despite improving macro conditions and VIX at 52-week lows, sector rotation remains constrained by narrow participation and mixed fundamentals, creating a disconnect between L1's aggressive stance and L2's neutral positioning that favors selectivity over broad sector bets.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (LOW confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias and improving risk appetite. However, L2 rotation shows NEUTRAL bias with no offensive leadership, creating a disconnect. VIX at 52-week lows supports risk-on environment but narrow participation limits sector momentum.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nSignals validated against v6.1 thresholds: 3 NEUTRAL sectors in Zone E, 4 WEAKENING sectors in Zone B showing momentum deterioration, 4 AVOID sectors in Zone D. No bullish signals present despite improving macro backdrop.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: E (3 sectors in noise), B (4 sectors weakening), D (4 sectors in ignition/avoidance). No sectors in momentum zones A or F. Rotation direction is mixed with broad-based weakness developing across previously strong sectors.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nL1 AGGRESSIVE vs L2 NEUTRAL conflict resolved by recognizing narrow market participation. While macro conditions improve, sector rotation remains constrained. News sentiment mixed with healthcare and industrials positive but financials negative.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nEARLY_EXPANSION classification with LOW confidence reflects the market's transitional state. While L1 macro conditions suggest improving risk appetite with VIX at 52-week lows, sector rotation patterns don't show the typical early-cycle leadership from cyclicals and growth sectors. Instead, we see broad-based momentum deterioration across multiple sectors, suggesting the expansion phase is either very early or facing structural headwinds that prevent clear directional rotation.\n\nKey Insight: Despite improving macro conditions and VIX at 52-week lows, sector rotation remains constrained by narrow participation and mixed fundamentals, creating a disconnect between L1's aggressive stance and L2's neutral positioning that favors selectivity over broad sector bets."
