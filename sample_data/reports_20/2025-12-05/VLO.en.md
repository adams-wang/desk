**2. Should Valero’s Refining Margin Rebound and 97% Utilization in Q3 2025 Require Action From Valero Energy (VLO) Investors?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251204T124623 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Valero Energy reported strong Q3 2025 results with US$32.17 billion in revenue and a significant rebound in refining performance, achieving 97% throughput utilization. This operational efficiency and higher refining margins strengthen the company's short-term earnings despite ongoing policy risks related to renewables and potential asset impairments. Investors should consider these factors alongside the company's maintained US$1.13 quarterly dividend, but remain aware of potential policy shifts impacting RIN obligations and California’s LCFS.

**3. Is Par Pacific's Refining Business More Resilient & Competitive?**
- Source: Finviz | 20251205T113900 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 75%
- Par Pacific Holdings Inc. (PARR) is a refining company with a 219,000 barrels per day capacity, utilizing a diverse crude oil supply from U.S. inland fields, imported waterborne sources, and Canadian heavy oil. This diversified sourcing, particularly the use of cheaper Canadian heavy oil, gives PARR a cost advantage over competitors like Phillips 66 (PSX) and Valero Energy Corp (VLO). PARR's shares have significantly outperformed the industry, and the company currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

**4. Phillips 66 (PSX): Reassessing Valuation After Q3 Earnings Beat and Strong Refining Performance**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251203T072233 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 65%
- Phillips 66 (PSX) exceeded Q3 revenue and earnings expectations, driven by strong refining margins, leading to a significant year-to-date share price return. Despite a narrative fair value of $268.71 suggesting undervaluation, the company's high P/E ratio compared to the industry indicates potential valuation risk if market sentiment shifts. Investors are encouraged to consider both the growth initiatives and potential risks to the upbeat valuation.

**5. Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR) lifts 2025 tax credit sales to $185M with new $60M deal**

- Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE: DAR) announced a new agreement to sell approximately $60 million in production tax credits generated by its Diamond Green Diesel joint venture under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
