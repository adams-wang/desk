- Citigroup expects its investment banking (IB) fees to increase in the mid-20s percentage year over year in Q4 2025, driven by momentum in M&A and capital markets activity.

**4. Citigroup (NYSE: C) offers SONIA CMS7 notes with 3.819% strike and capped payout**
- Source: Stock Titan | 20251216T110811 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. is issuing principal-at-risk medium-term senior notes, Series N, guaranteed by Citigroup Inc., linked to the 7-year GBP SONIA ICE swap rate (SONIA CMS7). These notes, maturing on March 18, 2026, offer a capped maximum payment if the SONIA CMS7 rate is at or above the 3.819% strike, but entail significant principal-at-risk if the rate falls below the strike. The securities are complex, highly risky, and will not be listed on any exchange, meaning liquidity will be limited and investors should be prepared to hold them until maturity.

**5. Citigroup (C) Stock Hits Fresh 52‑Week High After Major Shake‑Up: Latest News, Analyst Targets and 2026 Outlook**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251216T110744 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Citigroup (C) stock recently hit a new 52-week high of $112 following a major leadership reshuffle and reorganization of its U.S. consumer business in late November. The bank reported strong Q3 2025 earnings and anticipates robust Q4 investment banking fees, leading to largely bullish analyst ratings with price targets slightly above current levels. Despite the rally, risks remain regarding the execution of its massive restructuring, leadership changes, and potential macroeconomic shifts, with the stock still considered reasonably valued but requiring sustained performance to fully re-rate.
