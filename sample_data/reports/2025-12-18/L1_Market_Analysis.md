    - Title: Adecoagro downgraded to ’BB-’ by S&P on higher leverage after Profertil deal
    - Summary: S&P Global Ratings has downgraded Adecoagro S.A. to 'BB-' from 'BB' with a negative outlook due to expected higher leverage following its acquisition of Profertil. The rating agency forecasts Adecoagro’s leverage to peak at 4.7x by the end of 2025 and also noted weaker operational performance with a projected nominal EBITDA of $400 million for 2025, down from $569 million in 2024. S&P highlights execution risks in integrating Profertil and increased exposure to Argentina, which could lead to further rating downgrades if leverage remains high or liquidity weakens.
