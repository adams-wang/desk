- This article notes a discrepancy where major oil company stocks like Chevron, Exxon, and SLB are experiencing significant gains despite stable oil prices.

While this intervention could allow U.S. companies to re-enter a country with the world's largest proven oil reserves, analysts caution that significant investment and a stable environment are needed for meaningful production increases.
