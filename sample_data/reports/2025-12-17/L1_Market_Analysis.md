**Conflicts & Divergences**
- VIX rising but put/call ratio declining to 0.827 suggests institutional hedging rather than retail panic
- Economic fundamentals stable but equity volatility increasing - disconnect between macro and micro stress
- Yield curve normal while tech sector under pressure - sector-specific rather than systemic risk

**Positioning Guidance**
- Regime: RISK_OFF (DETERIORATING)
- Confidence: HIGH
- Position size: 90% max
- Key action: Reduce exposure on any tech rally as AI infrastructure cost concerns build momentum

**Triggers**
- Upgrade: VIX decline below 15 with improving breadth above 55%, Tech sector stabilization with reduced AI capex concerns
- Downgrade: VIX break above 22 with breadth falling below 45%, AI bubble narrative accelerating with more prominent short positions

**Risk Factors**
- AI infrastructure cost concerns spreading beyond initial tech names
- Market breadth deteriorating with narrow leadership vulnerable to rotation
- Rising volatility from complacent levels suggesting regime change in progress
- Prominent investor short positions in AI stocks gaining attention
