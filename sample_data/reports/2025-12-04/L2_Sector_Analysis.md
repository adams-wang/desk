## Sector Analysis

### Executive Summary
Cycle phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (MEDIUM confidence). Rotation bias: NEUTRAL. Key insight: Market shows early expansion characteristics but lacks conviction, with all sectors clustered in neutral/negative territory - suggesting a tentative recovery phase where cyclical positioning is preferred but without aggressive allocation due to uncertain momentum.

### Market Narrative
- Weakness in Real Estate, Basic Materials, Consumer Defensive: interest rate impact, commercial real estate stress, REIT valuations; commodity price weakness, China demand concerns, inventory buildup.

### Rotation Summary
Current rotation pattern shows unusual defensive weakness during a NORMAL macro regime, with traditional safe-haven sectors (Healthcare, Consumer Defensive, Utilities) all underperforming significantly. The clustering of six sectors in neutral Zone E territory suggests a market in transition, lacking clear directional conviction. Energy's leadership despite being in neutral territory indicates commodity resilience, while the broad underperformance of rate-sensitive sectors (REITs, Utilities) reflects persistent interest rate concerns. The absence of any bullish signals across all sectors suggests a market pause rather than aggressive rotation, consistent with the LOW velocity reading.

### L1 Alignment
Sector rotation aligns with L1's NORMAL regime and AGGRESSIVE position bias, as cyclical sectors show relative strength over defensives. However, the absence of strong bullish signals reflects the MEDIUM confidence in the macro regime, suggesting markets are positioned for growth but without strong conviction.
