**1. Why a $30 Million Bruker Stock Trim Matters Amid an 18% Slide**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251226T170926 | Neutral | Relevance: 65%
- Grandeur Peak Global Advisors significantly reduced its stake in Bruker Corporation by selling 709,697 shares, representing a $29.54 million net position change in Q3. This move comes as Bruker's stock has slid 18% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500, and is attributed to fading confidence due to declining revenues and organic growth. Despite cost-cutting measures, analysts suggest investors are being asked to wait for a rebound while other opportunities may offer faster growth.
