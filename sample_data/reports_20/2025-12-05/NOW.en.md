- ServiceNow announced its plan to acquire non-human identity (NHI) management provider Veza to enhance its security, risk, and governance portfolio, with reports suggesting a $1 billion valuation. The acquisition will integrate Veza's Access Graph into ServiceNow's workflows, strengthening the management of machine identities and permissions within the company's offerings, including its new AI Control Tower.

**3. ServiceNow (NOW) Stock Today: Veza Deal, 5‑for‑1 Split and AI Growth Shape the December 4, 2025 Outlook**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251204T210833 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- ServiceNow (NOW) closed on December 4, 2025, at $834.02, reflecting a 0.13% gain amidst a busy period for the company including a planned 5-for-1 stock split and the acquisition of identity-security specialist Veza. The company's Q3 2025 earnings showed strong fundamental growth, especially in AI-driven offerings, with a target to exceed $1 billion in AI-related ACV in 2026. While Wall Street largely remains bullish on NOW, quantitative and technical models suggest near-term caution due to its premium valuation and potential market competition.

**4. NOW's Veza Buyout Expands Portfolio: What's Ahead for the Stock?**
- Source: TradingView | 20251204T160812 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- ServiceNow is acquiring Veza, an AI-native identity security provider, to expand its security and risk portfolio and address the increasing complexity of enterprise identities due to AI adoption. This acquisition is expected to bolster ServiceNow's top-line growth, although its subscription revenue growth guidance for 2025 indicates a slower pace than previous years, partly due to tightening U.S. federal agency budgets. The company also faces strong competition from Atlassian and Salesforce, and its stock has underperformed the sector and appears overvalued based on its forward price/sales.

ServiceNow President Amit Zavery stated that the acquisition will help customers confidently deploy AI by ensuring security and governance. Veza's "Access Graph" technology is particularly valuable for mapping access privileges across various entities, including AI agents which pose unique access control challenges.
