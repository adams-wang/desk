**3. Roper Is A Vertical Software Acquisition Machine**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251222T183747 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 97%
- Roper Technologies operates by acquiring companies that generate free cash flow, which is then used for further acquisitions. While this strategy has been effective, the company's recent focus on premium businesses has led to higher acquisition multiples, impacting returns. Morningstar views the improved portfolio quality positively but expects continued high multiples to weigh on Roper's returns.

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
