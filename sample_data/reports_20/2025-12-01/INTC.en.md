- Intel Corp. (INTC) shares surged 10.3% following analyst optimism that the company could secure a deal to supply Apple Inc. with its lowest-end M-series chips within the next two years. This news comes after Intel secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia Corp. in September, alongside a joint development partnership for AI infrastructure and personal computing products. These developments signal a more positive long-term outlook for Intel, despite remaining behind rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.

- Source: Finviz | 20251201T091100 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- Intel Corporation's stock surged 10.28% on Friday, finishing at $40.56, driven by analyst optimism that it could supply Apple Inc.'s lowest-end M-series chips within the next two years. This potential deal, alongside a recent $5 billion investment from Nvidia Corp., significantly improves Intel's long-term outlook despite competition from TSMC. The company's recent strategic moves aim to bolster its business and solidify its position in the chip market.

**4. Intel Stock on November 30, 2025: Apple Foundry Rumors, TSMC Lawsuit and AI GPU Bets Drive Volatile Rally**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251130T022150 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 97%
- Intel's stock experienced a volatile rally driven by rumors of Apple potentially tapping Intel as a foundry supplier for its M-series processors, which led to a significant surge. This speculative upside is balanced by a deepening legal dispute with TSMC over alleged trade-secret theft involving a former executive. The stock's performance is also bolstered by broader AI GPU market tailwinds, improved Q3 2025 financials, significant government backing, and strategic partnerships, despite cautious analyst sentiment.

**5. Intel Stock After the Bell (Dec. 1, 2025): Apple Foundry Buzz Keeps INTC Near $40 as Legal Risks Grow**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251201T215226 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stock closed near $40 on December 1, 2025, cooling slightly after a 10% Black Friday surge, driven by rumors of Apple potentially using Intel's 18A process for entry-level M-series chips starting in 2027. This positive buzz is counterbalanced by a trade-secret lawsuit from TSMC against a new Intel executive and a highly divided Wall Street analyst sentiment, with many seeing limited upside despite the stock doubling in the past year. Investors are closely watching upcoming investor conferences and further developments in the Apple rumors and legal challenges.
