- Source: Sahm | 20251217T050909 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 64%
- EPR Properties has funded new golf and water park acquisitions with a $400 million equity program, while maintaining dividends, reflecting a doubling down on its experiential real estate strategy. Despite a 14.21% year-to-date share price return, the market is cautious about dilution risks, yet long-term shareholder returns remain strong. The company is considered undervalued with a fair value of $58.35 against a current price of $50.23, supported by a conservative balance sheet and potential for growth from new assets.

**5. Macerich (MAC): Exploring Whether Recent Multi‑Year Rebound Still Leaves the REIT Undervalued**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T093303 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- Macerich (MAC) has experienced a significant rebound, with its stock climbing 6% in the past month and achieving over 80% total shareholder returns over three to five years, despite a recent 1-day dip. While a narrative places its fair value at $19.53, suggesting it's undervalued due to its focus on experiential retail, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model indicates a much stronger undervaluation, with an estimated fair value of $31, implying investors may be underestimating its earning potential. However, high leverage and exposure to challenging mall markets pose risks to its valuation upside.
