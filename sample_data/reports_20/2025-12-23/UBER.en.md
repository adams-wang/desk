- Uber (NYSE: UBER) is navigating a complex landscape on December 23, 2025, with increasing robotaxi momentum countered by a significant FTC lawsuit risk. The company is actively pursuing partnerships for autonomous vehicle deployment globally, including a new U.K. trial with Baidu, while simultaneously facing a U.S. Federal Trade Commission complaint regarding its Uber One subscription practices. This dynamic environment leads to varied analyst sentiment, with strong fundamentals acknowledged but long-term autonomy and regulatory risks creating uncertainty around future valuation.

- An investigation by The New York Times reveals that Uber's background check process, designed to quickly onboard drivers and minimize costs, has approved individuals with serious criminal convictions, including violent felonies. The company's screening criteria exclude only a narrow set of crimes like murder and sexual assault, and its look-back period for convictions in many states is limited. This has led to concerns about passenger safety despite Uber's assurances.
