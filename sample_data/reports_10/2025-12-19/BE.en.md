2. Heavy insider selling: $12M sold (9 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 5.0x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Elevated short interest (11.1%): bears positioning against stock.
5. Near-term weakness: 19.0% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
