**1. How a New Jersey utility helped customers save $720M on power bills**
- Source: Stock Titan | 20251217T180227 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 75%
- PSE&G (Public Service Electric & Gas) has been ranked #1 for residential electric customer satisfaction in the East among large utilities by J.D. Power for the fourth consecutive year, based on a survey of 127,103 residential customers. The utility's energy efficiency programs have seen nearly 465,000 participants, resulting in an estimated annual savings of over $720 million on utility bills. PSE&G also engaged in more than 450 community events in 2025 to assist customers with payment programs and energy cost management.

**2. Beyond Cost Metrics: Recognizing the True Value of Nuclear Energy**
- Source: FTI Consulting | 20251218T140945 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 73%
- This article argues that traditional cost metrics like Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) are insufficient for evaluating nuclear power, especially with increasing electricity demand and grid reliability pressures. It introduces two new metrics, Levelized Value of Energy (LVOE) and Levelized Net Benefit (LNB), which incorporate broader system benefits and owner value. Applying these to advanced nuclear and solar projects in U.S. markets, the analysis concludes that nuclear offers significantly greater overall value despite a higher LCOE, highlighting its unpriced contributions to reliability, fuel savings, and long-term cost containment.

**3. Tentative agreement with Georgia Power could mean new capacity for data centers**
- Source: Grice Connect | 20251217T150912 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 61%
- Georgia Power has reached a tentative agreement with state regulators to significantly expand its energy production, primarily from natural gas, to meet the growing demand from data centers across the state. This deal, allowing nearly the full expansion requested by Georgia Power, faces a critical vote by the Public Service Commission next week amidst concerns from consumer advocates and incoming commissioners about potential ratepayer risks and the long-term costs of such a large-scale project. Despite some opposition, proponents argue the expansion is crucial for economic growth and job creation, while Georgia Power has offered guarantees to protect residential rates from associated costs for a limited period.
