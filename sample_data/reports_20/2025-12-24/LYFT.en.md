3. Insider selling cluster: $3.3M in recent transactions.
4. High short interest (15.6%, 3.1 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
5. Near-term weakness: 6.0% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 3 raises (avg +47%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
