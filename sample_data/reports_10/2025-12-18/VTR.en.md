**1. Welltower (WELL): Reassessing Valuation After a Strong 3-Month and 1-Year Share Price Rally**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T153026 | Neutral | Relevance: 62%
- Welltower (WELL) has seen its share price rally significantly, up 15% in three months and 50% in the last year, prompting a reassessment of its valuation. While a narrative fair value suggests the stock is undervalued at $207.38 due to aggressive growth assumptions and acquisitions like Amica Senior Living, another view highlights that the market is already paying a steep price, with a P/E ratio of 136x earnings. Investors need to consider if the current premium reflects sustainable growth or if the stock is vulnerable to market corrections from stretched expectations.
