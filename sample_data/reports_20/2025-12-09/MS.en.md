- Morgan Stanley's new analyst, Andrew Percoco, has downgraded Tesla stock from "overweight" to "equal-weight," despite raising the price target to $425. This downgrade is attributed to the belief that Tesla's current valuation already fully discounts its leadership in EVs, manufacturing, AI, and renewable energy.

- Source: CNBC | 20251207T234921 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Morgan Stanley's new Tesla analyst, Andrew Percoco, has downgraded Tesla's stock to "equal weight" from "overweight" due to valuation concerns, despite raising his price target to $425. Percoco noted that Tesla shares are trading at 30 times the firm's EBITDA estimate for 2030, and he expects a "choppy trading environment" for the stock over the next year. This move positions him against the majority of Wall Street analysts who currently hold "strong buy" or "buy" ratings for Tesla.

-  A former Morgan Stanley broker is seeking to overturn a $1.2 million arbitration award related to promissory notes, claiming arbitrators disregarded critical evidence. Marcio Moraes Marciano da Rocha argues he was retaliated against for attempting to blow the whistle on a client's alleged tax evasion.

**5. Tesla Downgraded by Morgan Stanley on Valuation Concerns**
- Source: TradingView | 20251208T150903 | Neutral | Relevance: 96%
-  Morgan Stanley downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Equal Weight from Overweight, citing valuation concerns that already reflect most expected gains from its artificial intelligence initiatives. The firm set a $425 price target, noting that while Tesla remains strong, optimism around its non-auto businesses limits risk-reward. The updated valuation incorporates higher long-term assumptions for Full Self Driving and network services, but lowers auto valuation due to reduced volume estimates amid slower EV adoption and rising competition.
