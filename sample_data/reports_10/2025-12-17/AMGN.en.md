- Morgan Stanley trimmed its price target for Amgen (AMGN) from $329 to $304, maintaining an Equal Weight rating, citing easing policy risks for the biopharma industry in 2026. This comes after Amgen announced a 6% increase in its quarterly dividend, marking 15 consecutive years of increases, and reported strong Q3 2025 results with a 12% revenue jump and 14% volume growth. The company is also expanding in its main therapeutic areas and investing heavily in US manufacturing.

**2. Amgen Stock (AMGN) News Today, Dec. 16, 2025: Dividend Boost, FDA Wins, Analyst Targets, and Key 2026 Catalysts**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251216T190935 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) is in focus today due to a fresh dividend raise to $2.52 per share for Q1 2026, recent FDA approval of UPLIZNA for generalized myasthenia gravis, and ongoing developments in its pipeline, particularly with MariTide in the obesity race. Analysts have mixed targets, but the company's Q3 2025 financial beat and raised guidance provide a defensive appeal for long-term investors. Key catalysts to watch include MariTide's late-2025 data readouts, Repatha adoption, and potential analyst revisions based on new clinical and commercial updates.

**3. What Amgen (AMGN)'s Expanded UPLIZNA Approval in Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Means For Shareholders**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251216T052453 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Amgen recently received FDA approval for an expanded label for UPLIZNA, now including adults with generalized myasthenia gravis who are anti-AChR and anti-MuSK antibody positive. This approval strengthens Amgen's position in rare autoimmune diseases, offering a differentiated b-cell therapy with low-frequency dosing. While this expands Amgen's rare-disease reach, the company still faces challenges from biosimilar erosion and drug pricing pressures, though a recent dividend increase signals management's confidence in cash flow durability.

This positive adjustment follows the FDA's recent approval of UPLIZNA for generalized myasthenia gravis, providing a new treatment option for patients. Amgen, focusing on innovative biologic medicines for serious conditions, is seen by HSBC as robust heading into the new year.
