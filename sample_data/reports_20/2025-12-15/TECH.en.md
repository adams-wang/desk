**4. Pinning Down Bio-Techne Corporation's (NASDAQ:TECH) P/S Is Difficult Right Now**
- Source: 富途牛牛 | 20251214T130858 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Bio-Techne Corporation (NASDAQ:TECH) currently has a high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 7.5x compared to the Life Sciences industry median of 3.3x, making it appear overvalued.
