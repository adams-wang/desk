The rejections were due to wasteful expenses, including those related to ComEd's problematic customer billing system rollout last year.

- The state-run Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) announced it will freeze electricity rates for the first quarter of next year, maintaining the adjusted unit fuel cost at 5 won per kilowatt-hour (kWh). This decision aims to improve KEPCO's financial stability, despite recent declines in global energy prices, as the company grapples with significant accumulated debt. The government has directed KEPCO to maintain the current rate, acknowledging the company's financial situation and past unadjusted fuel cost charges.

- Georgia Power, a subsidiary of The Southern Company (SO), has received approval for a major electric generation expansion aimed at meeting the increasing demand from data centers, particularly those supporting artificial intelligence development. The plan, estimated to cost $16.3 billion but potentially $50-$60 billion for customers over time, intends to spread fixed costs across a broader customer base, with large users like data centers bearing a disproportionate share. Critics, however, express skepticism about demand forecasts and raise concerns about financial risks for existing customers and environmental impacts from new natural gas plants.

The new members, along with the three existing ones, will fill seven out of the nine total seats.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
