2. Valuation stretched: PEG 3.3x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (20.2%, 4.0 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
4. Long-term trend broken: trading 12.3% below SMA200.

### Catalysts

- AI/machine learning initiatives could drive multiple expansion if executed.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

MACD histogram positive (0.52), confirming momentum. Volume at 48% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
