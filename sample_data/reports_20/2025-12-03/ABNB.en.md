**5. Airbnb stock price target raised to $118 by Wells Fargo on RNPL success**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251201T071300 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Wells Fargo has increased its price target for Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) to $118 from $111, attributing the raise to the successful implementation of the company's Reserve Now Pay Later (RNPL) policy. The RNPL feature, launched in the U.S. in August, boosted U.S. gross booking value and is projected to add an incremental $117 million to Airbnb’s EBITDA as it expands internationally. Despite a current Underweight rating, Airbnb shows a strong balance sheet and appears undervalued based on InvestingPro's Fair Value assessment.
