### Key Risks

1. Heavy insider selling: $54M sold (6 transactions in 90 days).
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 10.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 10.06 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (margin 18%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (48.7x), $8.2B free cash flow. Insider selling cluster ($54.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 4 selling).

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite persisting. Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
