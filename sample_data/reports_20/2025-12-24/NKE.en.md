- Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) stock declined on December 22, 2025, primarily due to sector-wide pressure following disappointing results from Nike, which impacted athletic retail exposure. Despite ASO's recent Q3 fiscal 2025 report showing improved profitability, narrowed full-year outlook, and gross margin expansion, investor caution persists regarding comparable sales and brand-driven demand signals.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
