-  A LendingTree survey reveals that 27% of self-checkout users have intentionally stolen items, a significant increase from 15% in 2023. The primary motivations cited for this rise in theft are the unaffordability of essentials and price increases due to tariffs. Despite risks, 55% of those who purposefully stole expect to do it again, driven by frustration over high prices.

### Market Context

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
