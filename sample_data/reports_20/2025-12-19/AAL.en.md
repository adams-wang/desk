- American Airlines announced 15 new routes for the summer of 2026, aiming to enhance domestic and international connectivity. This expansion includes new service to Lincoln, Nebraska, and further strengthens its hubs, particularly Chicago O'Hare, which will see over 500 daily departures. The airline continues to grow its network to provide more travel options across the U.S. and globally.

**3. American Airlines limits perks for basic economy tickets. What to know.**
- Source: USA Today | 20251218T135400 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- American Airlines has announced that basic economy tickets will no longer earn AAdvantage miles or Loyalty Points toward status, aligning its policy with other major carriers like Delta. While this change encourages customers to purchase higher-fare tickets, basic economy passengers will still retain benefits such as a personal item, a carry-on bag, and complimentary in-flight amenities. Southwest Airlines, however, maintains its policy of allowing basic economy tickets to earn Rapid Rewards points.

**4. American Airlines adds tough new basic economy restriction**
- Source: The Points Guy | 20251218T011115 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- American Airlines has announced a new restriction for its basic economy tickets, effective from December 17, 2025, which will prevent AAdvantage members from earning miles or Loyalty Points. This change eliminates the previous reduced earnings of 2 miles and Loyalty Points per dollar spent, making American's basic economy policy more aligned with Delta Air Lines, which also offers no loyalty earnings on its similar "Main Basic" tickets. The move is a significant blow to AAdvantage members who previously accepted basic economy restrictions for cost savings and partial loyalty benefits.
