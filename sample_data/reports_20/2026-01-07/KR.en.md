- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20260106T140824 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Kroger (KR) has been downgraded to Hold due to a deteriorating core grocery business, despite advancements in its digital strategy. The company is experiencing decelerating identical sales growth, significant headwinds in its pharmacy segment, and market share loss to competitors like Walmart and Costco.

| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
