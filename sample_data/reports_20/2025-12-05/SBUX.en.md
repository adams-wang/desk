- Starbucks stock has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the past one, three, and five years, with notable declines in price. This poor performance is attributed to lackluster fundamentals, including steep declines in net income and weak comparable sales despite some top-line growth.

- A U.S. appeals court panel has expressed skepticism regarding a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruling that former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz illegally threatened a union supporter. Judges questioned whether Schultz's remarks to a barista in 2022 were coercive threats intended to discourage unionizing, noting that Schultz had explicitly promised no retaliation to workers. This case highlights ongoing tensions between the NLRB and courts, particularly concerning executives' free speech in unionization efforts, with Starbucks facing numerous ongoing complaints and appeals related to labor practices.

**5. Starbucks to pay $35M to NYC workers in settlement as ongoing strike draws Mamdani and Sanders to picket line**
- Source: PBS | 20251203T050927 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 99%
- Starbucks will pay approximately $35 million to over 15,000 New York City employees to settle claims that the company denied them stable schedules and arbitrarily cut their hours. This settlement coincides with an ongoing strike by Starbucks' union, which garnered support from Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders on the picket line. The workers are demanding improved hours and staffing, and a fair contract, as Starbucks has yet to agree to one nearly four years after the first unionization vote.
