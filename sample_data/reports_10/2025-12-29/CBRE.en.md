**1. MGM Resorts Secures Higher Licensing Fees in New Macau Agreement**
- Source: iGamingToday.com | 20251227T010841 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- MGM Resorts International’s Macau subsidiary, MGM China Holdings Ltd, will face significantly higher licensing fees for using the MGM brand under a new agreement taking effect January 1, 2026. The fee will double from 1.75 percent to 3.5 percent of adjusted consolidated net monthly revenues, with an annual cap up to US$188 million, reflecting the parent company's increased leverage and Macau's gaming sector recovery. This long-term agreement extends until 2032, aligning with MGM China's concession, and adjusts revenue distribution to favor MGM Resorts, which will now receive 67 percent of the licensing fees.

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
