1. High beta (4.24) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (22.0%, 1.5 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
4. Near-term weakness: 15.1% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_10 improving +6.6% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX remains in the mid-range, breadth is moderate, and yield curve is flat but not inverted—indicating standard late-cycle conditions. Upbeat earnings and positive tech momentum are offset by cautious guidance in consumer sectors, suggesting selective positioning is favored.*
