- Energy Fuels Inc. (UUUU) has seen a 180% increase in stock value over the past year due to its involvement in uranium and rare earths, and support from the U.S. government. However, the article argues that its valuation is currently stretched, leading to a "Hold" rating despite the company's strengths like its White Mesa Mill and innovative rare earths sourcing.
