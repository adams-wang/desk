**1. Why One Firm Exited $11 Million CyberArk Stake as Stock Rallied 44% Over the Past Year**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20251202T050919 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- G2 Investment Partners Management, a New York City-based firm, fully exited its $11.2 million position in CyberArk Software Ltd. during the third quarter, as revealed in an SEC filing. This divestment occurred despite CyberArk's stock rallying 44% over the past year and the company demonstrating strong fundamentals, including significant revenue growth and record net new Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR). The move suggests a potential rebalancing of G2's portfolio towards small- and mid-cap growth stocks, rather than reflecting weakness in CyberArk's business as it approaches an acquisition by Palo Alto Networks.
