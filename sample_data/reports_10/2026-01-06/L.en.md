- A Loews Corp. insurance subsidiary, Continental Insurance Co., has filed a complaint seeking to cap its liability for asbestos-related claims.

- A Loews Corp. insurance unit, Continental Insurance Co., is attempting to cap its liability for asbestos-related claims stemming from a nickel refinery in Louisiana. The insurer argues that multiple exposure claims from the facility, dating back to the 1970s, should be considered a single "occurrence" under its liability policies. This move aims to limit the financial burden associated with continuous asbestos conditions at the plant.

**3. Investors Continue Waiting On Sidelines For Loews Corporation (NYSE:L)**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T164830 | Neutral | Relevance: 96%
- Loews Corporation (NYSE:L) currently trades at a P/E ratio of 14.9x, which is lower than the average P/E of over 20x for many US companies. Despite a recent 9.1% earnings decrease, the company has shown impressive 114% EPS growth over the last three years, outperforming the market's 16% predicted growth. This disparity suggests investors may be wary of the company's ability to maintain its recent growth rates, leading to a lower valuation.
