- Live Nation is attempting to dismiss the Department of Justice's antitrust lawsuit, arguing that the DOJ has failed to present any evidence of actual harm to the industry. The company claims the government's case is based on hypothetical models and narrow market definitions, and that allegations of coercive contracts and tied services lack concrete proof from venues or artists. The decision now rests with U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, who will determine if the case proceeds to trial.
