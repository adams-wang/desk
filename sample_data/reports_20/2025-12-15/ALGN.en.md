**2. Baird downgrades Zimmer Biomet stock rating to Neutral on market share concerns**
- Source: Investing.com UK | 20251216T094638 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 64%
- Baird has downgraded Zimmer Biomet's stock rating from Outperform to Neutral and reduced its price target due to concerns about the company's market share in hip and knee replacement markets, despite good product uptake. The downgrade reflects Zimmer Biomet's struggle to keep pace with competitors like Stryker's MAKO robotic system and downward revisions in analyst earnings expectations. This comes amidst recent FDA clearance for Zimmer Biomet's enhanced knee surgery robot, ROSA Knee with OptimiZe, and mixed third-quarter results that fell short of guidance.
