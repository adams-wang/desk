-  The global economy continued to expand at a robust pace in November, though slightly softened compared to October, with the J.P.Morgan Global PMI Composite Output Index at 52.7.

- Source: S&P Global | 20251208T030924 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
-  Global economic growth in November remained robust but was heavily dependent on a strong expansion in financial services, driven by supportive financial conditions like lower interest rates and high asset prices. Many other sectors experienced modest or slowing growth, with the automotive sector being the only one to report a decline in output. This reliance on financial services activity underscores a key driver of the global economic recovery, although some signs suggest this impetus may be fading.
