**2. Universal Health Services stock price target lowered to $245 at TD Cowen**
- Source: Investing.com UK | 20260107T121323 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 99%
- TD Cowen has reduced its price target for Universal Health Services (NYSE:UHS) to $245 from $251, while maintaining a Buy rating. This adjustment reflects concerns over the potential non-extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, leading to a 2% cut in fiscal year 2026 adjusted EBITDA estimates. Despite this, the new target still suggests an 11% upside, and the company is pursuing mitigation strategies and has pending Supplemental Payment Program applications that could offset headwinds.

**4. Is Ensign Group (NASDAQ:ENSG) Using Too Much Debt?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T000915 | Neutral | Relevance: 62%
- The Ensign Group has approximately US$142.7m in debt but maintains a net cash position of US$363.6m due to its US$506.3m cash reserves. While total liabilities are significant at US$1.98b more than current assets, the company's large market capitalization of US$10.0b and a 44% boost in EBIT suggest its debt usage is not overly risky. The ability to convert 71% of EBIT to free cash flow further strengthens its financial stability.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
