- Canopy Growth's (CGC) stock outlook for December 2025 highlights a company undergoing a high-risk turnaround, marked by recent debt prepayments and improved Q2 FY2026 earnings with narrowed losses and increased margins. Despite these positive financial adjustments, the company faces pressures from a new U.S. securities class action lawsuit and a divided analyst community regarding its future potential. Its balance sheet is stronger due to equity raises, but profitability remains elusive, making it a speculative investment.
