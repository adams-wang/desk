**1. Will CEO D Bidzos’s Ongoing Stock Sales Reshape VeriSign’s (VRSN) Long‑Term Confidence Narrative?**

- VeriSign's Executive Chairman, President, and CEO D Bidzos has recently sold 9,000 company shares, adding to a year of significant insider selling, which raises questions about the long-term outlook of the core domain registry business. Despite this, VeriSign continues its capital return program, including dividends and share buybacks, while the company forecasts revenue and earnings growth. Investors are encouraged to consider the balance sheet risks and insider behavior alongside community forecasts and the company's projected fair value.

- Over the last year, insiders at VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN) sold a significant US$42 million worth of shares, outweighing the US$20k in shares they purchased. This selling activity, particularly a US$15 million sale in the last three months with no corresponding purchases, suggests that some insiders may believe the stock is not cheap. Despite high insider ownership of 0.7% (worth US$166 million), the consistent insider selling indicates a degree of caution.
