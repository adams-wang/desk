- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T012327 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- IBM (IBM) has experienced a recent pullback, dropping 5% over the past month, but still boasts a strong 34.31% return over the past year. Analysts generally see a slim upside from its current price of $291.5, with a consensus target of $281.316, although some bullish forecasts reach $350. The article questions whether IBM's future growth from hybrid cloud and AI is already factored into its current valuation, noting its P/E ratio is higher than peers, yet Simply Wall St's fair ratio suggests potential for the market to edge higher.

**3. Dan Ives Sees 25% Tech Stock Breakout — Micron And Three Bargain Stocks Stand Out**
- Source: Benzinga | 20260106T142621 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 62%
- Wedbush analyst Dan Ives predicts a potential 25% upside for the tech sector this year, highlighting that several tech stocks are currently undervalued. He identifies Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) as an "undervalued" stock that is already gaining momentum, and also points to Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (NASDAQ: CTSH), and Adobe Inc (NASDAQ: ADBE) as bargain opportunities due to their attractive valuations and earnings visibility. Ives suggests that the current pricing of these stocks doesn't fully reflect their potential for growth and recovery.
