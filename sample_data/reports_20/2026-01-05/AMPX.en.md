Despite a high price-to-sales ratio of 19.5x compared to an industry average below 2x, its strong revenue growth of 234% last year and an anticipated 83% annual growth for the next three years (versus 16% for the industry) suggests investors are willing to pay a premium for its strong future prospects.
