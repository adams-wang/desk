This achievement confirms Energy Fuels as the sole non-Chinese producer capable of supplying both "heavy" rare earth elements like dysprosium and neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr), crucial for electric vehicles and defense. The company's White Mesa Mill, originally a uranium facility, has shown its ability to manage the complex separation processes for rare earths, leading to significant stock growth and an initiation of "Buy" coverage by Texas Capital.

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
