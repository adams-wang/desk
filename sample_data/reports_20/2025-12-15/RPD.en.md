- Rapid7 has identified a new malware-as-a-service (MaaS) called SantaStealer, previously BluelineStealer, which is being advertised for release this holiday season. Despite developer claims of being "fully undetected," Rapid7 found samples easily detectable and noted its "amateurish" yet "ambitious" development. The malware, written in C, aims to exfiltrate sensitive data and includes 14 modules, some exploiting a WinRAR vulnerability, and offers customizable builds with tiered pricing.
