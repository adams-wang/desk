- Lucid Motors (LCID) is making a strong year-end push to meet its revised production guidance, with a record 27 car carriers spotted at its manufacturing plant loaded with Gravity and Air models. The company aims to produce 18,000 vehicles for the year, nearly double its 2025 output, despite earlier production challenges for the Gravity SUV.

- Lucid Group stock has fallen 65% in 2025 due to significant cash burn, negative gross margins on its vehicles, and a weakening broader EV market exacerbated by policy changes. Despite securing substantial funding and plans for new models and a second factory, investors are concerned about the company's path to profitability and stability amidst leadership changes and control by Saudi Arabia's PIF. The stock remains highly volatile and risky until it can successfully launch its midsize platform, achieve positive gross margins, and demonstrate strong consumer demand.
