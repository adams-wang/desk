- JFrog Ltd. (NASDAQ: FROG) has seen its shares nearly double over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500 significantly due to accelerating revenue growth, earnings beats, and enthusiasm for its AI and security upgrades. The company operates a "Liquid Software" platform that helps organizations manage software packages and AI models, with strong growth in cloud revenue and large customers. Despite its rich valuation and ongoing GAAP losses, JFrog's strong cash flow, net cash position, and leadership in DevOps, DevSecOps, and MLOps trends position it well for continued growth, though its high volatility may deter risk-averse investors.
