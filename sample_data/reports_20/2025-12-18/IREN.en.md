- Iris Energy (IREN) shares have significantly declined following concerns about a substantial funding gap required to fulfill its multi-billion dollar GPU cloud contract with Microsoft, despite an initial surge in early November. This decline is exacerbated by a major investor, Paul Tudor Jones, reducing his stake, and broader pressures from both the Bitcoin mining and AI sectors. The market awaits the company's quarterly report on February 11, 2026, for clarity on its capital deployment plans.

### Key Risks

3. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. High short interest (19.7%, 1.4 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
5. Near-term weakness: 32.6% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
