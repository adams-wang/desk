-  Jim Cramer commented on IREN, formerly Iris Energy, after it secured a contract with Microsoft and subsequently issued shares and a convertible bond to fund data center expansion.

Cramer acknowledged IREN as a good company but highlighted the risks associated with continuous fundraising and market pressures on spending.
