- Duke Energy (DUK) is under investor scrutiny, with its recent stock performance showing a 6.47% decline over 90 days but a 14.40% gain over the last year. Conflicting fair value estimates exist, with one narrative suggesting a 13.8% undervaluation at $136.18 due to its clean energy investments, while a DCF model indicates the current $117.44 price is overvalued with a fair value closer to $64.38. The discrepancy highlights the importance of underlying assumptions in valuation models.

*RISK_ON regime with strong participation and low volatility. VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) with breadth at 63.5% signals healthy risk appetite. Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
