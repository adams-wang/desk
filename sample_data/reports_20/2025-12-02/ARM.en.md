### Key Risks

1. High beta (4.25) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Premium valuation (P/E 60x, PEG 2.8x) vulnerable to multiple compression.
3. Elevated short interest (9.6%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 2.75 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (margin 19%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (5.6x), low leverage (D/E 0.31). Revenue growth strong at 21% YoY. Analyst sentiment positive (1 raises, avg +16%). Institutional flow bullish (3 buying vs 6 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -11.4% to -5.8% (+5.7% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 9.8pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (1.0%) - potential reversal signal. AM_20 at -4.2% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 5.2pp, stock-specific weakness. Below SMA200 (0.99x), long-term trend not supportive. Volume at 49% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
