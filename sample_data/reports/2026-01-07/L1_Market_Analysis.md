## Market Analysis

**Executive Summary**
- Regime: NORMAL (stable conditions)
- Key Drivers: NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.
- Positioning: Maintain standard positioning; elevated put/call warrants watchfulness but not action with VIX calm and breadth healthy.
