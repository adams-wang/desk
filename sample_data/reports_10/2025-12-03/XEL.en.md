**1. Xcel Energy Halves North Dakota Electricity Rate Hike Request, but 13% Residential Increase Still Looms**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251202T121823 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Xcel Energy has agreed to nearly halve its requested electricity rate increase in North Dakota, resulting in an overall 10.37% rise and a 12.92% increase for residential customers, down from original requests of 19.34% and over 24% respectively. The proposed settlement still requires approval from the North Dakota Public Service Commission and includes provisions like an earnings-sharing mechanism and compromises on coal plant depreciation and a "coal adder." This adjustment means a typical residential customer could see an increase of $14-$15 per month, with regulators hoping to balance utility profits with customer protection.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
