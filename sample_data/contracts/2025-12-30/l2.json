  "cycle_reasoning": "CONTRACTION phase identified due to mixed sector leadership with no clear cyclical or defensive dominance. While 5 sectors show TREND signals, they span both defensive (Real Estate, Healthcare, Communication) and cyclical (Materials, Industrials) categories. The absence of Technology and Consumer Cyclical leadership, combined with Financial weakness, suggests economic uncertainty. The LOW rotation velocity indicates stable but cautious positioning as markets process Fed policy implications.",
  "rotation_analysis": "The sector rotation pattern reveals a market in transition, with both defensive and cyclical sectors showing strength while traditional growth areas consolidate. Real Estate leads with 1.03% 5-day momentum, benefiting from REIT acquisition activity and stable income models. Healthcare maintains strong positioning with biotech breakthroughs and FDA approvals driving sentiment. Basic Materials shows the strongest 20-day performance at 1.94%, supported by industrial capacity investments. Communication Services benefits from smart money flows seeking steady cash flows. The notable weakness in Financials (-0.02% 5-day momentum) reflects hawkish Fed concerns, while Technology and Consumer sectors remain range-bound. This mixed rotation suggests market uncertainty as investors balance growth and defensive positioning heading into 2026.",
  "l1_alignment": "L1's NORMAL regime with defensive tilt recommendation aligns well with the mixed sector rotation showing both defensive leaders (XLRE, XLV, XLC) and cyclical strength (XLB, XLI). The AGGRESSIVE position bias supports the 5 TREND sectors, while the defensive tilt matches the underperformance in rate-sensitive Financials and consolidation in growth sectors like Technology.",
  "key_insight": "The market is exhibiting a rare balanced rotation where both defensive and cyclical sectors are leading simultaneously, suggesting investors are positioning for multiple scenarios as they process hawkish Fed signals while maintaining exposure to economic growth themes - this creates opportunity in quality names across sectors rather than concentrated bets.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: CONTRACTION (MEDIUM confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias but defensive tilt recommended. Sector rotation shows mixed signals with 5 TREND sectors (Real Estate, Communication, Healthcare, Materials, Industrials) and 1 WEAKENING (Financials). The defensive tilt in L1 aligns with Healthcare and Real Estate leadership, while the AGGRESSIVE bias supports Materials and Industrials strength.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll v6.1 signals validated against thresholds. 5 sectors in Zone A (TREND), 5 in Zone E (NEUTRAL), 1 in Zone B (WEAKENING). No anomalies detected. Signal distribution shows balanced rotation with no extreme concentrations. MRS_20 ranges from -0.20% to 1.94%, MRS_5 from -0.54% to 1.45%, all within normal ranges.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: Zone A (5 sectors - XLRE, XLC, XLV, XLB, XLI), Zone E (5 sectors - XLE, XLU, XLP, XLK, XLY), Zone B (1 sector - XLF). No sectors in toxic Zone C or momentum Zone F. Rotation direction is mixed with both defensive (XLRE, XLV) and cyclical (XLB, XLI) sectors leading, suggesting market uncertainty.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nL1 NORMAL regime with defensive tilt aligns well with mixed sector rotation. The presence of both defensive leaders (Real Estate, Healthcare) and cyclical strength (Materials, Industrials) reflects the balanced risk sentiment described in L1. Financial weakness (XLF WEAKENING) supports the hawkish Fed narrative driving defensive positioning.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nCONTRACTION phase identified due to mixed sector leadership with no clear cyclical or defensive dominance. While 5 sectors show TREND signals, they span both defensive (Real Estate, Healthcare, Communication) and cyclical (Materials, Industrials) categories. The absence of Technology and Consumer Cyclical leadership, combined with Financial weakness, suggests economic uncertainty. The LOW rotation velocity indicates stable but cautious positioning as markets process Fed policy implications.\n\nKey Insight: The market is exhibiting a rare balanced rotation where both defensive and cyclical sectors are leading simultaneously, suggesting investors are positioning for multiple scenarios as they process hawkish Fed signals while maintaining exposure to economic growth themes - this creates opportunity in quality names across sectors rather than concentrated bets."
