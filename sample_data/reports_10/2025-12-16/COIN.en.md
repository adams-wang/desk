- Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) stock is holding firm around $252 after the company officially reincorporated from Delaware to Texas on December 15, 2025. This legal and governance shift does not affect Coinbase's business operations, management, or assets, and its Class A shares continue to trade on Nasdaq under the "COIN" ticker.

- Source: cointurk finance | 20251214T130937 | Bearish | Relevance: 80%
- The Roundhill COIN WeeklyPay ETF (COIW) offers weekly dividends with 120% leveraged exposure to Coinbase stock, a strategy that relies on total return swaps rather than traditional dividend income. This approach results in highly volatile payouts categorized as return of capital, posing significant risks, especially for retirement investors seeking stable income. The article suggests alternatives like the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI) for more consistent dividend yields and lower volatility.
