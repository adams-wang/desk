**1. MGM Resorts and MGM China Sign Long-Term Branding Agreement**
- Source: Hotel News Resource | 20251229T180902 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- MGM Resorts International has signed a long-term branding agreement with MGM China Holdings Limited, effective January 1, 2026, allowing MGM China to use the "MGM" name through 2032 with possible extensions. This deal stabilizes MGM China's brand rights and eliminates annual renegotiations, while increasing the monthly license fee from 1.75% to 3.5% of MGM China's adjusted consolidated net monthly revenue for MGM Resorts. The agreement reflects MGM China's substantial market share growth post-pandemic and aims to enhance MGM Resorts' brand presence in key markets.

**2. MGM Resorts Extends Casino Branding Deal in China’s Macau Through License Term**
- Source: Casino.org | 20251229T163556 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- MGM Resorts International has extended its branding agreement with MGM China through 2032, coinciding with MGM China's gaming concession term in Macau. The new terms significantly increase the monthly licensing fee paid by MGM China to MGM Resorts from 1.75% to 3.5% of its adjusted consolidated net revenue, which analysts believe will negatively impact MGM China's near-term EBITDA. This extension aims to secure MGM China's brand usage and reflects the increased market share MGM China has achieved in Macau's gaming industry.

**3. MGM Resorts and MGM China extend branding agreement**
- Source: ReadWrite | 20251229T112040 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- MGM Resorts International has signed a new long-term branding deal with MGM China Holdings, extending their partnership as MGM China continues to show strong financial performance, especially in Macau. The agreement, effective January 1, 2026, will run until Macau’s current gaming concession ends in 2032 and automatically extend further if new concessions are granted. Under the updated terms, MGM China will pay a higher monthly license fee, increasing to 3.5% of its adjusted consolidated net monthly revenue, with MGM Resorts receiving two-thirds of this fee.

**4. NoMad Las Vegas to Become the Reserve at Park MGM**
- Source: Hospitality Design | 20251230T133435 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- The NoMad Las Vegas has been rebranded as the Reserve at Park MGM by MGM Resorts International. This change includes new identities for public spaces like the pool and restaurants, and the property is expected to join Marriott Bonvoy’s Autograph Collection in early 2026, expanding the MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy to 13 Las Vegas properties.

**5. Morgan Stanley Downgrades MGM China Stock Rating While MGM International Posts Gains**
- Source: Eudaimonia and Co | 20251229T131036 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 95%
- Morgan Stanley downgraded MGM China's stock rating from Overweight to Equal-weight due to anticipated higher royalty payments to its parent company, MGM Resorts International, which are expected to decrease future earnings. Despite MGM China's stock experiencing a significant single-day slump following news of the new branding agreement, MGM Resorts International posted gains. The royalty payments will increase significantly, impacting MGM China's profit margins, while MGM Resorts International benefits from the branding agreement and shows positive year-to-date performance.
