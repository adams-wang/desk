- Source: ts2.tech | 20251221T130925 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- SanDisk stock (SNDK) showed strong momentum on December 20, 2025, trading around $237.61, driven by a sector-wide re-rating after Micron's bullish AI-driven memory demand outlook. Analysts like Benchmark and Citi have raised their price targets, anticipating significant revenue and EPS growth for SanDisk through 2027 due to the company's re-listing, S&P 500 inclusion, and strong positioning in the re-accelerating memory cycle. The bullish sentiment is countered by potential volatility stemming from overall AI market froth, ramp costs, and a possible shift in investor sentiment.
