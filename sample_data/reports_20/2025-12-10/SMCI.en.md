-  Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock has dropped to around $34, down 40% from its 2025 peak, reflecting investor skepticism due to repeated earnings misses and gross-margin compression, despite strong AI-server demand. The company missed Q1 FY2026 revenue expectations due to configuration delays and data-center constraints, leading to a significant drop in EPS. Maintaining a bullish bias, analysts project an upside towards $55 if gross margins rebound above 10%, emphasizing that margin trajectory, not topline growth, will determine SMCI's fair value.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
