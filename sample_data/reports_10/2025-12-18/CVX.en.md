**1. Exxon vs. Chevron - Which Oil Giant Is a Buy for 2026?**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20251217T150744 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- This article analyzes whether ExxonMobil (XOM) or Chevron (CVX) is a better investment for 2026, considering their Q3 2025 performance, strategies, and valuations. While both are strong companies, Chevron is deemed slightly better positioned due to its lower capital intensity, stronger cash flow durability in a softer oil market, and growing exposure to natural gas demand. Both currently hold a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

**2. Chevron (CVX) Highlighted in Mizuho’s 2026 Energy Outlook**
- Source: Insider Monkey | 20251217T142200 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Mizuho has reiterated its "Outperform" rating on Chevron (CVX) and raised its price target, highlighting the company in its 2026 energy outlook due to "underappreciated value" in exploration and production stocks, despite current market sentiment. The firm anticipates improved longer-term fundamentals for oil-focused E&Ps. Additionally, Chevron recently made headlines for lowering prices on Venezuelan crude amid a tanker seizure by US forces and softening global oil prices, all while maintaining compliance with US sanctions.

**3. After TechnipFMC, Subsea7 hired for Chevron’s gas project offshore Australia**
- Source: Offshore-Energy.biz | 20251216T120751 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Subsea7 has been awarded a substantial contract, valued between $150 million and $300 million, by Chevron for subsea equipment and infrastructure for the third stage of its Gorgon gas project offshore Western Australia. This contract, following TechnipFMC's earlier award for subsea production systems, involves project management, engineering, procurement, fabrication, transportation, installation, and pre-commissioning of subsea equipment at 1,350 meters water depth, with offshore operations expected in 2028. The Gorgon Stage 3 development will include three manifolds and a 35-kilometer production flowline, and six wells, as the first in a series of planned subsea tie-backs for the Chevron-operated project.

**4. Has Chevron’s Recent Share Slip Opened the Door to a 2025 Value Opportunity?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T224815 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Chevron's stock has recently slipped 6.9%, leading to flat year-to-date returns and a 3.7% 1-year gain, leaving the market split on its future. Despite ongoing debates about energy transition and industry consolidation, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Chevron is undervalued by 56.2%, while its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, though higher than the industry average, also hints at slight undervaluation compared to its fundamental Fair Ratio. Investors are encouraged to consider various "Narratives" for Chevron's future, ranging from bullish to cautious, to make informed decisions.

**5. Chevron to supply Hungary with 2 billion cubic metres of LNG, minister says**
- Source: Reuters | 20251216T170810 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Hungary's state-owned MVM group has signed a 5-year deal with U.S. energy company Chevron for the supply of 2 billion cubic metres of liquefied natural gas (LNG). This agreement diversifies Hungary's energy sources as it seeks to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas, despite previously resisting EU efforts to phase out Russian energy imports. The deal secures 400 million cubic metres of LNG annually and underscores Hungary's strategy to procure energy from various sources to ensure competitive pricing.
