-  Tripadvisor (TRIP) is facing activist investor pressure and rolling out a new rewards program, Tripadvisor Rewards, to boost user engagement and monetization for its Viator and TheFork businesses. While activists aim to scrutinize profitability, the rewards program directly addresses user retention, potentially reducing reliance on costly marketing and driving higher-value bookings. The success of these initiatives will be crucial for Tripadvisor's investment narrative, especially as its core travel guidance segment remains under pressure.
