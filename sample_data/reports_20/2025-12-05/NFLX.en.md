To finance this massive deal, Netflix is taking on a $59 billion bridge loan, making it one of the largest debt burdens ever for an acquisition, though it is still outpaced by Anheuser-Busch InBev's $75 billion loan in 2015 for SABMiller.

Discovery's TV and film studios and streaming division for $72 billion US, a deal that would give the streaming giant control of one of Hollywood's oldest and most prized assets. This acquisition is expected to face significant antitrust scrutiny in both Europe and the U.S. due to concerns about market concentration and its impact on consumers and content creators, despite Netflix's claims that it would benefit consumers through bundled offerings and continued cinema releases.
