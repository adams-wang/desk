### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
