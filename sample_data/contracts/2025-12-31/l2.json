While defensive sectors lead, the presence of Basic Materials in trend zone and improving Energy/Utilities momentum suggests market isn't in full risk-off mode.

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: CONTRACTION (HIGH confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias. Sector rotation shows defensive leadership (XLC, XLV, XLRE) which creates some tension but is resolved by Fed rate cut environment driving smart money into defensive sectors with attractive valuations.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll signals validate correctly: 4 TREND sectors in Zone A with positive MRS_5, 6 NEUTRAL in Zone E, 1 WEAKENING in Zone B with negative MRS_5. No anomalies detected vs thresholds.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: A (4 sectors - defensive-led), E (6 sectors - mixed), B (1 sector - financials weakening). Rotation direction is defensive with Communication Services, Healthcare, Real Estate leading while Technology and Consumer Cyclical lag.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nL1 AGGRESSIVE vs L2 defensive rotation resolved by Fed rate cut context. Smart money rotating into defensive sectors with reasonable valuations rather than pure risk-off. News confirms this with sector rotation themes away from semiconductors into steady cash flow sectors.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nCONTRACTION phase identified with high confidence as defensive sectors (XLC, XLV, XLRE) dominate leadership while cyclicals (XLY, XLK) underperform. Financial Services weakening despite previous strength is classic late-cycle behavior. Four sectors in trend zones but led by defensives rather than cyclicals confirms contractionary environment.\n\nKey Insight: Smart money is executing a defensive rotation driven by Fed rate cuts, moving capital from overvalued semiconductors/hardware into Communication Services and Healthcare sectors that offer reasonable valuations, steady cash flows, and dividend appeal - a classic late-cycle positioning strategy."
