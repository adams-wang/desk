- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251219T142819 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Equity Residential (EQR) has seen a 5% gain in the past month, suggesting stabilizing sentiment despite negative year-to-date returns. The stock is considered 11.8% undervalued with a narrative fair value of around $70.38, driven by its focus on urban, supply-constrained markets that benefit from demographic shifts. However, softer rent growth and high interest rates pose potential risks to its earnings and valuation optimism.

- Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA) has announced a higher quarterly dividend of US$1.53 per share, extending its annual dividend growth streak to 16 years. This reinforces its income investment appeal, despite management having cut full-year EPS guidance in October 2025.
