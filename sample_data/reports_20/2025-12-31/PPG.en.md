- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251229T102300 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) utilizes debt in its business, holding US$7.31 billion with a net debt of US$5.40 billion after accounting for US$1.92 billion in cash. The company's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.0 and strong interest cover of 30.8 times indicate a good position to manage its debt levels, despite a slight drop in EBIT over the last year. PPG Industries' ability to generate sturdy free cash flow, equating to 56% of its EBIT, further supports its capacity to reduce debt.

**5. Does PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?**
- Source: 富途牛牛 | 20251231T060809 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- PPG Industries uses debt, with US$7.31b at September 2025, but its net debt is US$5.40b after accounting for cash reserves. While its interest cover is strong at 30.8 times, indicating good debt management, a 2.6% slide in EBIT over the last year raises some concerns about future debt capacity. Overall, PPG Industries appears to be managing its debt reasonably well but shareholders should monitor its debt load.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
