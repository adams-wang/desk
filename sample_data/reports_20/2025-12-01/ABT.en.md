**4. Exact Sciences sale could benefit both companies, local economist says**
- Source: The Cap Times | 20251201T060000 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- A local economist suggests that the acquisition of Madison-based Exact Sciences by Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories will likely be a net positive for both companies. Abbott gains cancer diagnostics for its portfolio, while Exact Sciences achieves international reach it previously lacked. While some roles might become duplicative, the main labs and a significant workforce are expected to remain in Madison, though a potential loss in community investment from the change in local leadership is noted.

Industry observers believe the acquisition will transform cancer screening by integrating it more deeply into primary care services and expanding access globally.
