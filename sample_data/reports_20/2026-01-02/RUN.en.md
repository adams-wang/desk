- Sunrun Inc. shares fell 3.8% in afternoon trading on Wednesday, extending a pullback in rate-sensitive solar names, primarily due to rising U.S. Treasury yields. Higher borrowing costs negatively impact residential solar installers by increasing customer monthly payments and pressuring financing-heavy business models. The stock's volatility underscores how quickly sentiment can shift in the residential solar sector based on policy and interest-rate expectations.
