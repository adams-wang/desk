**1. Fed rate-cut odds climb on softer-than-expected ADP data**
- Source: Equiti Global | 20251203T223556 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Odds for a Federal Reserve rate cut increased after November's ADP private payroll data showed an unexpected contraction of 32,000 jobs, falling short of expectations. This prompted investors to price in a higher probability of a 25 basis-point cut at the December FOMC meeting, despite the ISM services PMI showing continued resilience in the US services sector. Other economic news included Australia's Q3 GDP decelerating and a modest build in US crude inventories.

**2. ADP National Employment Report: Private Sector Employment Shed 32,000 Jobs in November; Annual Pay Was Up 4.4%**

- The ADP National Employment Report for November 2025 revealed a decrease of 32,000 private sector jobs, alongside a 4.4% year-over-year increase in annual pay. This slowdown in hiring was broad-based and notably led by a pullback in small businesses, reflecting cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. The report also highlights weak hiring in sectors like manufacturing, professional and business services, information, and construction, while pay growth for job-stayers and job-changers saw a slight deceleration.

- Source: Sahm | 20251203T200808 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- The ADP National Employment Report indicates that private sector employment decreased by 32,000 jobs in November 2025, with annual pay growth at 4.4%. This slowdown was attributed to cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment, particularly impacting small businesses and industries like manufacturing and information. Job creation has stagnated in the latter half of 2025, and pay growth is on a downward trend.

**4. ADP Disappoints: -32K Private Sector Jobs Last Month**
- Source: TradingView | 20251203T150553 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- The ADP jobs report for November revealed a disappointing -32K private sector jobs, significantly below expectations, primarily due to large losses in small businesses. This marks the fourth negative month in six for private-sector payroll growth and highlights a tightening labor market. The report also touched on unchanged import and export prices for September and briefly impacted pre-market stock futures.

**5. US private payrolls fall 32,000 in November, ADP reports - CHOSUNBIZ**
- Source: Chosunbiz | 20251203T135631 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- US private payrolls unexpectedly fell by 32,000 in November, marking the first decline since early 2020, significantly missing economists' expectations for a gain. This decrease was largely driven by a substantial reduction in the leisure and hospitality sector, indicating a potential weakening in the labor market. The ADP report precedes official government jobs data later in the week.
