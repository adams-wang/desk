- Broadcom (AVGO) experienced a post-earnings selloff on December 14, 2025, despite record results and raised guidance, due to concerns over future AI business profitability and potential gross margin dips as custom chips and rack-level systems become a larger revenue segment. The market also reacted to a "mystery customer" for a $1 billion AI order, adding to investor ambiguity. Despite the immediate dip, analysts maintain a largely positive outlook, focusing on Broadcom's strong AI backlog, diversified revenue from VMware, and long-term potential, though sensitivity to profitability and valuation has increased.

- Shares of Rumble, Crane NXT, Arlo Technologies, CDW, and Insight Enterprises fell in an afternoon session due to investor rotation out of AI-linked stocks. This shift followed underwhelming earnings updates from Oracle and Broadcom, sparking fears that AI infrastructure spending might be outpacing monetization.

- AMD stock experienced a significant decline on Friday, December 12, 2025, driven by broader semiconductor and AI sector sentiment rather than AMD-specific news.

- AMD stock is experiencing pressure following a cooling in the "AI trade," with shares down 4.8% to $210.78 as of December 14, 2025. Despite strong Q3 2025 results and Q4 revenue guidance, the stock's performance is influenced by broader AI infrastructure spending concerns, Oracle and Broadcom headlines, and ongoing discussions about export controls. Analysts anticipate significant earnings growth into 2026, driven by AMD's long-term strategy in data-center AI and rack-scale systems.
