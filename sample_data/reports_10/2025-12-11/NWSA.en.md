-  Right-wing provocateur Laura Loomer has strongly criticized Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, labeling him a "selfish leftist" for his opposition to the proposed Nexstar Media-Tegna merger. Loomer argues that Ruddy's stance against lifting the 39% ownership cap for local TV stations, which would facilitate the merger, empowers the left-wing media and harms the MAGA movement. She asserts that Nexstar, unlike Ruddy, aligns with conservative values and President Trump, and that removing the cap would enable conservative local stations to better compete.
