-  Comcast President Mike Cavanagh stated that while the company's bid for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) had a low likelihood of success due to its lighter cash component, the process of exploring the acquisition made Comcast "better." He noted that the offer, focused on equity and substantial ownership in a combined entity, would have expanded Comcast's streaming ambitions globally. Despite WBD ultimately accepting Netflix's $82.7 billion cash and stock deal, Cavanagh believes Comcast's current strategy across theme parks, broadcasting, film, and streaming constitutes a "damn good hand."
