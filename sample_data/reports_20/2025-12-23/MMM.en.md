- US chemicals company 3M will make "goodwill" payments to businesses in the Westerschelde estuary affected by PFAS pollution from its Zwijndrecht, Belgium plant. The amount and recipients of the payments were not disclosed, but the move comes after 3M was formally held liable for the pollution in 2023.
