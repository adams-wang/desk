- AT&T's stock has declined 7.8% over the past six months, underperforming the Wireless National industry but outperforming T-Mobile. The company faces challenges in its Business Wireline segment due to lower demand for legacy services and increasing competition, which drives up customer acquisition costs. Despite these headwinds, AT&T is experiencing growth in wireless traction, fiber broadband, and expanding its portfolio with new technologies like FirstNet Fusion and AT&T Express Waves, and its valuation appears relatively cheaper compared to the industry average.
