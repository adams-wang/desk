-  Shares of freight delivery company RXO (NYSE: RXO) jumped 6.1% today after positive commentary at the Goldman Sachs Industrials and Materials Conference and a separate UBS conference resonated well with investors. This positive market reaction boosted confidence in the company's future direction despite its shares being down 39.4% year-to-date.

**4. Why Pure Storage Stock Took a Dirty Dive Today**
- Source: Finviz | 20251203T122200 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 88%
-  Pure Storage stock crashed by 26% despite reporting strong Q3 2026 earnings and exceeding revenue and earnings guidance. The dive is attributed to the stock's extremely high valuation of 233 times trailing earnings, which the earnings report, while positive, couldn't fully justify given the modest next-quarter guidance and slower recurring sales growth. This selloff erased previous gains, bringing the stock to a more "reasonable" but still rich valuation for potential investors.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
