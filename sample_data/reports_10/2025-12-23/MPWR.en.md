**1. Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Growth Fund Q3 2025 Portfolio Review**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251223T040832 | Bullish | Relevance: 99%
- Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Growth Fund released its Q3 2025 portfolio review, detailing key investment decisions. The fund initiated a position in Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) due to anticipated growth in energy-efficient electronics and AI demand, while also maintaining conviction in Ross Stores (ROST) for its strong performance and market positioning. Conversely, the fund reduced its exposure to Equitable Holdings (EQH) after disappointing earnings and exited Gartner (IT) due to missed targets and revised growth forecasts.

**2. Arista’s Secure AI Data Center Push With Fortinet Could Be A Game Changer For Arista Networks (ANET)**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251223T103852 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- Arista Networks is expanding its market reach beyond core data centers into AI-centric security, campus, and industrial edge use cases through collaborations like the Secure AI Data Center solution with Fortinet and new AI-driven campus networking features. While these moves are strategically important for diversification, the company still faces the risk of concentrated exposure to a few hyperscale and AI customers. Arista's projected revenue and earnings growth suggest a significant upside to its current price, but analyst views on customer concentration vary widely.
