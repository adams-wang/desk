- The WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Dividend Fund (DON) delivered a 70% return over five years and pays monthly dividends, holding about 400 mid-cap dividend stocks with a 2.45% yield. While it boasts diversification and a focus on mid-cap value, some top holdings exhibit stretched payout ratios which raises concerns about dividend sustainability. Despite trailing the S&P 500's total return, DON offers higher current income and lower concentration risk, positioning it as a steady income option for investors.
