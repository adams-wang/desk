### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.06 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 37.4x stretched relative to 13% growth. Quality metrics strong (ROE 24%). Insider selling cluster ($420.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 4 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -2.8% to -1.6% (+1.2% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 5.6pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (0.6%) - potential reversal signal. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.11x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). MACD histogram bearish (-0.74), momentum weakening. RSI neutral at 49. Volume at 58% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -SUL (Resistance).

### Position Sizing

- **Shares:** 338
- **Position Value:** $37,656.58
- **Portfolio %:** 37.66%

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
