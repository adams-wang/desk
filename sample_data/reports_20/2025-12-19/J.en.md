**3. Science Applications International (SAIC): Valuation Check After Ravi Dankanikote Becomes Chief Growth Officer**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251219T010935 | Neutral | Relevance: 58%
- Science Applications International (SAIC) has appointed Ravi Dankanikote as Chief Growth Officer, raising questions about the company's valuation as its share price has risen recently despite a negative year-to-date return. Simply Wall St's analysis suggests SAIC is 11.2% undervalued, with a narrative fair value of $113.38, driven by expected operational efficiencies and resilient margins rather than substantial headline growth.
