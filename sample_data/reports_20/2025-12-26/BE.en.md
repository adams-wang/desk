### Key Risks

2. Heavy insider selling: $21M sold (12 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.2x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Elevated short interest (11.3%): bears positioning against stock.
5. Near-term weakness: 16.8% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -10.6% to -9.2% (+1.4% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 13.2pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -8.4% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 9.8pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.65x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 44. Volume at 28% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -MLL (Support test).
