    - Summary: This article compares two major US rare-earth companies, MP Materials Corp (NYSE: MP) and USA Rare Earth Inc (NASDAQ: USAR), highlighting their different approaches in the rapidly growing rare-earth market. MP Materials is presented as a battle-tested operator with existing production and government backing, while USA Rare Earth offers high-risk, high-reward speculative upside through its ambitious plans for a fully integrated supply chain. The piece suggests that choosing between them depends on an investor's philosophical stance towards established production versus future potential in the critical rare-earth sector.

### L1 Alignment
Sector rotation aligns well with L1's NORMAL regime and moderate risk appetite. The mixed defensive/cyclical strength supports selective positioning rather than broad risk-taking, which matches the AGGRESSIVE bias tempered by Fed meeting uncertainty and elevated complacency (VIX 8th percentile).
