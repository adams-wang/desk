*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
