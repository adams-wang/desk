- AMD announced its "AI Everywhere, for Everyone" strategy at CES 2026, unveiling new technologies like the Helios rack-scale platform and Instinct MI400 series to bolster its AI presence. Despite strong AI initiatives and an expanding portfolio, the company faces stiff competition from NVIDIA and Intel, and its stock currently exhibits a stretched valuation. While strong growth is anticipated in data center AI revenues, the current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) suggests investors might wait for a better entry point.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*

### Earnings
