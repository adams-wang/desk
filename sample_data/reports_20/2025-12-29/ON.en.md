- ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) has received a consensus "Hold" rating from 29 analyst firms, with 15 holding and 14 recommending a buy, and an average 1-year price target of $59.35. The company recently beat earnings estimates but saw a 12% year-over-year revenue decline, setting Q4 2025 guidance at $0.570-$0.670 EPS. A significant $6.0 billion stock buyback authorization suggests management views the stock as undervalued, amidst active insider selling and institutional investment.

**2. EXEC: Lululemon Founder Looks to Proxy Fight to Fill Board Seats, New CEO Pick**
- Source: SGB Media Online | 20251229T153031 | Neutral | Relevance: 62%
- Lululemon Athletica, Inc. founder Chip Wilson is initiating a proxy fight to appoint three new independent directors to the company's Board, including the former co-CEO of On Holding, a former CMO of ESPN, and a former CEO of Activision. Wilson also proposes declassifying the Board so all directors are elected annually, emphasizing the need for visionary leadership due to what he perceives as a lack of board oversight and a failing succession plan for the outgoing CEO, Calvin McDonald. This move follows activist investor Elliott Management's stake acquisition and their intent to push their own CEO candidate.

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
