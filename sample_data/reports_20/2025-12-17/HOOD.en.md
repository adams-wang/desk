3. Heavy insider selling: $64M sold (24 transactions in 90 days).
4. Near-term weakness: 11.4% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

*RISK_OFF regime with deteriorating conditions. VIX rising to 17.6 (+11.7% over 5 days) signals increasing anxiety, while narrow breadth at 52.6% indicates selective participation. AI infrastructure cost concerns are pressuring tech leadership, creating sector rotation challenges in a late-cycle environment.*
