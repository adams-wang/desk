**1. Moderna Stock (MRNA) Today: Shares Cool Off After a Late-December Spike as Investors Focus on Bird Flu Funding, mNEXSPIKE’s EU Path, and 2026 Growth Targets**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251224T111246 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Moderna stock experienced a late-December surge followed by a significant pullback, settling around $32.29. The volatility is attributed to investor focus on bird flu funding from CEPI, the European Medicines Agency's progress on Moderna's mNEXSPIKE vaccine, and the company's financial strategies including a $1.5 billion loan and 2026 growth targets. Analysts currently hold a "Hold" consensus rating with an average 12-month price target of $33.25, reflecting the ongoing transition from a pandemic-driven business model to a multi-product biotech.

**2. Moderna Stock (MRNA) Drops on Dec. 23, 2025: Latest News, Analyst Forecasts, and What Investors Are Watching Next**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251223T194126 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Moderna (MRNA) shares dropped by roughly 6% on December 23, 2025, retracting after a significant multi-day rally. This decline is attributed more to profit-taking and volatility after a rapid ascent rather than a specific new announcement. Despite the drop, investors are weighing several key developments including new funding for its H5 vaccine, European regulatory progress for its next-gen COVID shot, and a drug delivery deal, as the company transitions from a "pandemic windfall machine" to a "multi-product biotech" with a focus on cost reduction and pipeline development.

**3. Moderna Announces Phase 3 Study of Investigational Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Vaccine Did Not Meet Primary Efficacy Endpoint**
- Source: The Fayetteville Observer | 20251223T010833 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Moderna announced that its investigational cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccine, mRNA-1647, failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint in a Phase 3 study for preventing CMV infection in women of childbearing age. Consequently, Moderna will discontinue its congenital CMV clinical development program but will continue to evaluate mRNA-1647 in an ongoing Phase 2 trial for bone marrow transplant patients. The company does not anticipate this outcome to impact its 2025 financial guidance or its goal of achieving breakeven in 2028.

**4. CEPI to Fund Pivotal Phase 3 Trial for Moderna's mRNA Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Candidate**
- Source: Florida Today | 20251222T180854 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) will invest up to $54.3 million to support a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for Moderna's mRNA-based H5 pandemic influenza vaccine candidate, mRNA-1018. This funding aims to accelerate the vaccine to licensure, bolstering global pandemic preparedness and ensuring equitable access, with Moderna allocating 20% of its manufacturing capacity to low- and middle-income countries. The trial, set to begin in early 2026, will build upon positive Phase 1/2 results, aiming to revolutionize pandemic response through the speed and adaptability of mRNA technology.

Moderna does not foresee any impact on its 2025 financial guidance or its target of achieving breakeven in 2028.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
