-  Pivotal Research Group downgraded Netflix stock to a hold rating from buy, lowering its target price to $105 per share due to the company's $72 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's film studio and streaming services. Analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak cited approval risk, a lengthy closing timeframe, and potential bidding war as headwinds. He also noted that the deal suggests Netflix's concern over declining subscriber engagement and the impact of short-form entertainment, leading to reduced subscriber and revenue forecasts.
