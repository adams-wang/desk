- Source: Kyiv Post | 20251229T103004 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Documents obtained by analytics firm Dallas indicate that Houston-based energy giant SLB (formerly Schlumberger) continued transferring proprietary drilling technology to Russian manufacturers as recently as February 2025, weeks after new US sanctions targeting Russia's oil sector took effect. This activity, including detailed engineering drawings for critical oil extraction equipment components, raises concerns that SLB is undermining US sanctions and supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | IGNITION (Zone D) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
