- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251221T105454 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- EQT (EQT) has retired its $496 million 7.5% Senior Notes due 2027, strengthening its balance sheet amid favorable natural gas market shifts and anticipated LNG demand growth. Despite trading 20% below consensus targets, the company's robust cash flows and LNG optionality raise questions about its valuation. Analysts suggest EQT is 15.8% undervalued due to accelerating U.S. LNG exports and its low-cost structure, though some see its 18.9x earnings multiple as less of a bargain compared to industry peers.
