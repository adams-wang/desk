- Genuine Parts Company reported a 4.9% increase in Q3 sales year-over-year and raised its full-year 2025 revenue growth outlook to 3-4%. While this indicates management's confidence and improves the near-term revenue catalyst, investors should also consider the pressure from inflation-driven SG&A growth and the maintained dividend despite trimmed EPS guidance. The company projects $26.3 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in earnings by 2028, requiring 3.5% yearly revenue growth.
