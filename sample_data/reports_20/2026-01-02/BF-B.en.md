### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -11.2% to -8.0% (+3.2% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 11.9pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (0.6%) - potential reversal signal. AM_20 at -8.5% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 8.0pp, stock-specific weakness. Below SMA200 (0.87x), long-term trend not supportive. Volume at 59% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +DBL (Indecision).
