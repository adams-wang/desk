**1. Rivian: Shares Fall as Deliveries Decline**
- Source: Morningstar | 20260105T160940 | Bearish | Relevance: 95%
- Rivian reported a significant decline in fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 deliveries, causing a 3% drop in share price. This decline is attributed to the expiration of the US EV tax credit, though the company anticipates a rise in 2026 deliveries with the launch of the new R2 midsize SUV. Morningstar maintains an "overvalued" rating for Rivian stock, citing concerns about 2026 expectations and projected negative free cash flow for several years.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
