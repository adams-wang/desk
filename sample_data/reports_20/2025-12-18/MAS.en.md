**1. Strategy To YieldBoost Masco From 1.9% To 12.6% Using Options**
- Source: Nasdaq | 20251217T170800 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- This article details an options strategy for Masco Corp. (MAS) shareholders to boost their income from a 1.9% dividend yield to 12.6%. The strategy involves selling an April 2026 covered call at the $70 strike price, collecting a premium that annualizes to an additional 10.7% return. This approach offers a significant yield boost, though it caps potential upside if the stock exceeds $70.

**2. Zurn Elkay Water Solutions (ZWS): Valuation Check After Upbeat Q3 Earnings and Fresh Analyst Buy Ratings**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T110852 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- Analysts have responded positively to Zurn Elkay Water Solutions (ZWS) after strong Q3 earnings and raised guidance, leading to fresh Buy ratings for the stock. Despite a significant share price increase of 27.8% year-to-date and 134.1% over three years, Simply Wall St suggests the company is currently undervalued by 8% with a fair value of $51.25. However, while the narrative supports higher earnings and margin expansion, an earnings-based valuation indicates the stock trades at 42.2 times earnings, higher than the industry average, which could pose a risk if growth slows.
