- Source: Benzinga | 20251205T035324 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
-  The SEC has issued warning letters to nine issuers, including ProShares, Direxion, and GraniteShares, pausing the launch of ultra-leveraged ETFs that promised returns up to five times the daily performance of individual stocks, sectors, and cryptocurrencies. This regulatory crackdown creates a power vacuum, benefiting existing 2x leveraged ETFs by giving them a scarcity premium. The pause raises questions about whether this is a temporary halt or a more fundamental shift in the leveraged ETF landscape, potentially pushing issuers towards alternative ETF structures.
