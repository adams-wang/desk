- Lucid (LCID) stock closed Friday down 3.3% at $11.41, with investors balancing product progress, such as the cheaper Gravity Touring variant and robotaxi partnerships, against ongoing cash burn and supply-chain constraints. Analysts are split between "EV winter" concerns and optimism about Lucid's long-term optionality, as the company continues to rely on significant funding from Saudi Arabia's PIF. Investors should monitor year-end liquidity, EV demand changes, and future production/delivery updates before markets reopen.

**5. Lucid (LCID) Valuation Check After a Modest Share Price Rebound**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251225T030935 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- Lucid Group (LCID) has seen a modest 6% rebound in its share price recently, sparking renewed interest from valuation-focused investors despite its significant year-to-date decline. The company's narrative fair value suggests it is 35.9% undervalued at $18.43, driven by anticipated growth from new EV platforms and advanced technology, though concerns remain about negative gross margins and capital reliance. While the market is skeptical, the upcoming launch of its mid-sized EV platform in late 2026 is expected to broaden its market and improve margins.
