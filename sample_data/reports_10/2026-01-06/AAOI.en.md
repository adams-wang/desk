- Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) shares fell nearly 11% after an initial push above $41, highlighting its volatility as an AI data-center optics play with significant short interest. Investors are now focused on late-February earnings and the company’s execution on 800G shipments, crucial for AI-linked data center capital spending. The company recently secured its first volume order for 800G transceivers and forecasts production capacity of 100,000 units per month by the end of 2025.

- Source: ts2.tech | 20260104T130841 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) shares surged 13.6% on the first trading day of 2026, closing at $39.60, driven by renewed investor interest in "AI infrastructure" stocks tied to data-center spending. The company, which produces lasers and high-speed optical transceivers crucial for AI data centers, recently received a significant volume order for 800G transceivers and is developing advanced pump lasers for AI systems. Investors are now watching for momentum into the next trading session and the company's upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report, expected around February 25, 2026.

**3. AAOI stock slides 8% as Applied Optoelectronics gives back Friday rally on AI optics trade**

- Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI) shares fell approximately 8% to $36.43 after previously rallying on an "AI optics" theme. The pullback reflects investors repricing the fast-moving AI optics sector and general market volatility in optical and networking names. Despite receiving its first volume order for 800G data-center transceivers and expecting $4-8 million in fourth-quarter revenue from these shipments, the company faces risks including potential dilution from stock offerings and reliance on a few key customers.
