-  Morgan Stanley increased its price target for Paramount Skydance (NASDAQ:PSKY) to $12.00 from $10.00, while maintaining an "Underweight" rating.

- Source: Benzinga | 20251210T080839 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 92%
- Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison met with Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders to advocate for Paramount's $108 billion all-cash bid over Netflix's $82.7 billion offer. Ellison aimed to alleviate concerns about Paramount's financing, leading some WBD shareholders to view Paramount's proposal favorably due to its potential for simpler regulatory clearance. The bidding war has driven WBD's stock up significantly, while both Paramount and Netflix consider sweetening their offers.

**3. Warner Bros. bidding war: Paramount & Netflix offers compared**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251208T123000 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 92%
-  Paramount Skydance has made an all-cash hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery for $30 per share, challenging Netflix's prior deal for only the studio and streaming units. This development creates a bidding war, with analysts comparing the offers and their potential benefits for Warner Bros. Discovery, while also noting concerns about financing and regulatory approval for the Paramount bid.

**4. Stocks making the biggest moves midday: Paramount Skydance, Wave Lifesciences, Confluent & more**
- Source: CNBC | 20251208T123500 | Bullish | Relevance: 91%
- Several companies experienced significant stock movements midday. Wave Life Sciences more than doubled after positive interim data for its obesity shot.

**5. Paramount and Warner Bros.: Hostile Bid Is Probably Superior to Netflix’s, but Not Clearly**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251208T200926 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 90%
-  Paramount's hostile bid of $30 per share for Warner Bros. Discovery is seen as potentially superior to Netflix's $27.75 cash and stock offer, primarily due to the certainty of the cash component and lower anticipated international regulatory scrutiny. While both bids value Warner above its independent worth and could lead to a bidding war, the author believes a Paramount acquisition offers better benefits for its shareholders than a Netflix acquisition. Morningstar maintains a $77 fair value estimate for Netflix and a $20 fair value estimate for Paramount, with plans to raise Warner's fair value to $28 if an acquisition occurs by early 2027.
