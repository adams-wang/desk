- Visa has made strides in AI agent payments and USDC settlement, contributing to a 7.75% share price return in the last month and an 11.08% year-to-date gain. Despite strong performance, a valuation check reveals that while a narrative fair value suggests it is 11.8% undervalued at $395.89, its current P/E ratio of 33.6x (compared to an industry average of 13.8x) flashes a caution signal. Investors are encouraged to consider the company's accelerating adoption of value-added services but also acknowledge potential risks from structural threats and regulatory scrutiny.
