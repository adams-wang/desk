- SLB appears to be undervalued based on its digital and low-carbon technology expansion, as indicated by both Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Price-to-Earnings (PE) analyses. The DCF model suggests a 57.0% discount compared to its intrinsic value, while its current PE ratio of 15.9x is below its proprietary "Fair Ratio" of 20.3x, implying potential undervaluation.
