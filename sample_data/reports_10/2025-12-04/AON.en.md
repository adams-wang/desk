- Investor comfort with insurance-linked securities (ILS) is crucial for their growth in Asia, despite the nascent market. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is launching a new grant scheme from January 2026 to December 2028 to incentivize ILS issuances, particularly for property catastrophe bonds covering Asia-Pacific risks. While ILS has a proven track record globally, education and regulatory support are key to increasing investor adoption in Asia.
