**1. NuScale Power Plunges 20% in a Month: Time to Hold Tight or Exit?**
- Source: TradingView | 20251210T150834 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
-  NuScale Power (SMR) shares have dropped over 20% in the last month, underperforming its industry due to weaker-than-expected Q3 2025 results and concerns over Fluor's plan to divest its stake. The company faces significant competition and large upfront investments for its small modular reactor projects, with meaningful revenues still years away. Given these challenges and a stretched valuation, the stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
