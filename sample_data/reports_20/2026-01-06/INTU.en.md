- Intuit Inc. shares rose 0.9% after Jefferies analyst Brent Thill named the TurboTax and QuickBooks owner as a top large-cap software pick for 2026, despite suggesting investors stay "underweight" on software generally. The call comes as Intuit approaches its crucial consumer tax season, with investors closely watching demand for its AI-powered financial products and the timing of its "Now This Is Taxes" campaign. Key factors for investors include the company's fiscal second-quarter guidance, its multi-year deal with OpenAI, and potential risks like consumers opting for cheaper tax preparation alternatives.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T100836 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Intuit Inc.'s high P/E ratio of 42.5x, significantly above the market average, is justified by its impressive past and projected future earnings growth. With EPS growth of 41% last year and an estimated 16% annual growth over the next three years (compared to the market's 11%), investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock. This strong growth expectation and investor confidence in future earnings stability are the primary reasons not to be concerned about its share price.

- Intuit Inc.'s (NASDAQ:INTU) P/E ratio of 42.5x is much higher than the market average in the US, where half of companies have P/E ratios below 19x. However, the company's strong earnings growth of 41% last year and an estimated 16% annual growth over the next three years, compared to the market's 11%, justifies this premium. Investors are comfortable with the high P/E due to the expectation of continued strong future earnings, supporting the share price.
