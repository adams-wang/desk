- Senator Elizabeth Warren has raised concerns that tech giants like Amazon and Meta might be shifting the electricity costs of their AI data centers to consumers. Her office, along with other senators, has sent letters to several tech companies, including Amazon, Meta, Alphabet (Google), and Microsoft, requesting details on their energy consumption and utility contracts, with responses due by January 12.

VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
