- Vulcan Materials (VMC) is increasingly seen as a long-term infrastructure play, benefiting from strong US infrastructure spending, resilient housing demand, and large public projects. The company's defensible business model, pricing power, and local market dominance contribute to this outlook, with the continuation of CEO Ronnie Pruitt's leadership being relevant for executing growth plans. Despite a positive infrastructure story, investors should be aware of potential funding risks.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
