1. High beta (3.41) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation risk: PEG 3.1x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
3. Elevated short interest (11.4%): bears positioning against stock.
4. Long-term trend broken: trading 50.5% below SMA200.
5. Falling knife pattern: rapid decline without stabilization, catch risk elevated.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
