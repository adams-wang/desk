- Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management is urging Comerica shareholders to vote against the proposed $10.9 billion acquisition by Fifth Third, arguing that Fifth Third is "contractually obligated" to increase its offer if the current deal is rejected. HoldCo believes that Fifth Third has significant room to improve its bid and that another suitor, reportedly Regions, is still interested if Fifth Third fails to raise its offer. Comerica shareholders are scheduled to vote on the acquisition on January 6, following a lawsuit filed by HoldCo against both banks over the deal's terms.
