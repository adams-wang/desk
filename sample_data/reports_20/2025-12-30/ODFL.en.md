### Key Risks

1. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-1.8% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 3.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 4 raises (avg +6%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 3.08 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 30.7x stretched relative to 8% growth. Quality metrics strong (ROE 25%, ROA 16%, margin 19%). Balance sheet: low leverage (D/E 0.29). Analyst sentiment positive (4 raises, avg +6%). Insider selling cluster ($1.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (4 buying vs 6 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 3.9% to 2.0% (-1.8% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 2.0pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 at 0.5% confirms short-term momentum alignment. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). Volume at 48% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +DUL (Resistance).
