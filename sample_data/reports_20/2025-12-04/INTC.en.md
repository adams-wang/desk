- Intel (INTC) stock has surged due to rumors of Apple becoming an Intel Foundry customer and a new $208 million expansion in Malaysia. While analysts remain cautious with "Hold" ratings and price targets below current levels, the news validates Intel's 18A process and strengthens its position in global manufacturing and U.S. industrial policy. The company's Q3 2025 results showed early improvements, but challenges remain in foundry execution and competition.

- Intel's stock surged 8.7% following rumors of a potential deal with Apple to develop M-series chips for MacBooks and iPad Pros by early 2027. This development, coupled with Intel's focus on AI PCs, new processor developments, and significant capital infusions from NVIDIA, Softbank, and the U.S. government, positions the company for growth despite past innovation lags and challenges in the Chinese market.
