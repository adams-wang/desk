- Moody's has downgraded Under Armour's corporate family rating to B1 from Ba3, citing ongoing difficulties in its operational turnaround due to cautious retailer orders, sluggish consumer spending, and rising tariffs. Despite these challenges, Moody's acknowledges Under Armour's strategy to boost brand appeal, led by CEO Kevin Plank, which is showing early benefits like improved gross margins.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
