*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX remains calm at 14.9 (8th percentile) with positive yield curve (+65bps) and healthy breadth (59.2%), though elevated put/call ratio (1.27) suggests institutional hedging despite surface calm. Focus on quality with awareness of hedging activity divergence.*
