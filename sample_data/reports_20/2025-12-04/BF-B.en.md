### Key Risks

1. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.7x requires aggressive growth execution.
2. Elevated short interest (14.9%): bears positioning against stock.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.73 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 17.1x stretched relative to 5% growth. Quality metrics strong (ROE 21%, margin 21%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (3.0x). Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 5 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 stable at 3.0% (minimal 5-day change). Below STRENGTH zone by 1.0pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 (-0.3%) diverging from MRS_20 - short-term weakness emerging. AM_20 at 5.1% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 4.0pp, stock-specific strength. Below SMA200 (0.97x), long-term trend not supportive. Elevated volume (2.1x 20MA), institutional activity likely. OFD pattern: -SUH (Resistance).
