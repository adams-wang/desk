- Bernstein SocGen Group has reduced its price target for Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALNY) to $491 from $525 due to a perceived slowdown in Amvuttra sales, particularly for ATTR-CM. Despite the lowered target, it remains significantly above the current trading price. The firm forecasts fourth-quarter 2025 Amvuttra sales below consensus, though Alnylam's overall revenue growth remains strong, and the company recently reported robust third-quarter financial results.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
