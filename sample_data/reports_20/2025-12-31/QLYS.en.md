**1. Why Qualys stock is sliding today: QLYS lags cybersecurity peers in late-year trade**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251230T154100 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Qualys (QLYS) shares fell by 2.5% in Tuesday afternoon trading, underperforming cybersecurity peers as investors focused on year-end positioning and Federal Reserve signals. This decline, which occurred amid light liquidity, was attributed to a healthy rebalancing of allocations rather than an emotionally driven sell-off, despite strong third-quarter revenue results announced in November. Traders are now watching for stabilization of the stock and upcoming macro cues, including January's jobs and consumer price reports and the next Fed meeting.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
