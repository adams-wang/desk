**Conflicts & Divergences**
- VIX calm at 15.77 vs elevated put/call ratio at 1.224 suggests institutional hedging despite surface calm

**Positioning Guidance**
- Regime: NORMAL (STABLE)
- Confidence: MEDIUM
- Position size: 100% max
- Key action: Maintain core positions with selective quality focus, as calm volatility and Fed easing support risk assets despite narrow breadth.

**Triggers**
- Upgrade: Breadth expansion above 60% signaling broad participation, VIX sustained below 14 indicating complacency opportunity, Credit spreads tightening on bank rate cuts
- Downgrade: Put/call ratio spike above 1.4 indicating fear escalation, VIX break above 20 signaling volatility regime shift, Breadth collapse below 45% showing broad weakness

**Risk Factors**
- Elevated put/call ratio at 1.224 suggests smart money hedging
- Narrow breadth at 53.4% indicates fragile market structure
- 42 days to next FOMC creates policy uncertainty window
