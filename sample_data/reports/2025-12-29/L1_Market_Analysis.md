**Conflicts & Divergences**
- VIX near historic lows (14.2) while put/call neutral (1.001) suggests options market more cautious than spot
- Defensive rotation in news (staples outperforming) conflicts with very low VIX reading
- Fed repo facility spike indicates liquidity stress not captured by calm surface indicators
- Breadth improving (+5.4pp) while NYSE A/D weak (0.66) shows selective buying

**Positioning Guidance**
- Regime: NORMAL (STABLE)
- Confidence: HIGH
- Position size: 115% max
- Key action: Maintain core positions but reduce leverage on rallies as defensive rotation and liquidity signals warrant caution despite calm VIX.

**Triggers**
- Upgrade: VIX sustains below 12 with breadth above 65%, Fed minutes confirm dovish stance with liquidity normalization, Economic data remains goldilocks with GDP acceleration
- Downgrade: VIX breaks above 18 with breadth falling below 45%, Fed minutes reveal hawkish surprise or liquidity concerns escalate, Economic data shows inflation reacceleration or employment weakness

**Risk Factors**
- Extreme VIX complacency at 2nd percentile creates asymmetric downside
- Fed repo facility usage surge signals hidden liquidity stress
- Defensive rotation suggests smart money positioning for volatility
- Year-end thin liquidity amplifies potential moves
- FOMC still 29 days away leaves extended uncertainty window
