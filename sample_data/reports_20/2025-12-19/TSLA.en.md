**1. Musk's 2018 Tesla Pay Plan Reinstated After 7-Year Battle**
- Source: Transport Topics | 20251219T221754 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- The Delaware Supreme Court has reinstated Elon Musk’s 2018 Tesla pay package, reversing a lower-court ruling that found improper influence on directors. This stock-based compensation plan, now valued at around $140 billion, had been previously approved twice by shareholders but blocked after an investor lawsuit. The decision follows Musk's criticism of Delaware courts and Tesla's move to reincorporate in Texas, coinciding with broader legal changes aimed at curbing similar shareholder suits.

- The Delaware Supreme Court has restored Elon Musk's 2018 Tesla pay package, overturning a lower court's decision that had previously invalidated the $56 billion compensation deal. This ruling means Musk can now receive compensation for his work since 2018, with the package currently valued at approximately $155 billion due to Tesla's stock price increase. Shareholders also approved a new, even larger pay plan in November that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla meets future targets.

**3. Tesla Stock Today (Dec. 19, 2025): TSLA Holds Near $483 as Regulators, Robotaxi Momentum, and New Price Targets Shape the Outlook**

- Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock remained near $483, navigating regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, with Italy closing EV consumer information probes without fines. The stock's performance is also driven by robotaxi momentum and varying analyst price targets, which range widely based on projections for autonomy and AI integration versus traditional EV sales. Despite demand softness and margin pressures in its core automotive business, the market increasingly values Tesla through an AI and autonomy lens.

**4. Elon Musk's SpaceX Reportedly Scoops Up Over 1,000 Cybertrucks As Tesla Struggles To Scale Demand**
- Source: Stocktwits | 20251218T180833 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Elon Musk's SpaceX has reportedly purchased over 1,000 Cybertrucks from Tesla, with plans to potentially increase this to 2,000, signifying a substantial investment of over $80 million. This comes as Tesla faces challenges in scaling demand for the Cybertruck, which has a higher price point than initially announced and has received mixed public opinion on its design. The acquisition highlights the collaborative nature among Musk's various companies, even as Tesla struggles with vehicle delivery numbers and potential year-over-year declines.

**5. Tesla stock rebounds around 5% today: what’s driving the rally?**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251218T160925 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Tesla stock rebounded by approximately 5% after a volatile session, suggesting investors are willing to buy dips despite concerns about its valuation and slowing automotive business. The rally is primarily driven by investor confidence in Elon Musk's AI vision, including driverless cars and robotics, rather than the core auto business. Analysts argue Tesla is now valued more as a robotics and autonomy company, with future execution of these technologies heavily influencing its high valuation.
