-  Transport Canada has announced a major recall involving 20,521 Ford Escape SUVs across Canada due to a structural issue where liftgate hinge covers could detach, posing a hazard. The recall affects models from 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2025. Ford will notify owners and provide free inspections or repairs to secure or replace the hinge covers.

**4. Why Did Ford File To Trademark Aviator In The UK?**
- Source: Ford Authority | 20251210T150757 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  Ford Motor Company recently filed to trademark "Aviator" in the UK, despite the Lincoln Aviator not currently being sold in that market or Europe. This move is unlikely to signal a launch of the Aviator in the UK, as Ford previously stated no plans to bring Lincoln to Europe. The filing is more probably a protective measure to prevent other entities from using the nameplate in the region, similar to past trademark filings for other models that never resulted in sales in those markets.
