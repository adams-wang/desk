  "full_analysis": "**REGIME ASSESSMENT: NORMAL/STABLE**\n\nCurrent market conditions reflect a NORMAL regime with STABLE transition characteristics. The VIX at 14.85 (8th percentile) suggests calm surface conditions, but this reading appears increasingly disconnected from underlying policy uncertainties and mixed corporate fundamentals.\n\n**KEY OBSERVATIONS:**\n\n*Volatility Dynamics:* VIX at 8th percentile indicates potential complacency, yet put/call ratio at 1.047 suggests institutional hedging activity. This divergence often precedes volatility expansion.\n\n*Market Breadth:* 57.6% of stocks above 50MA represents decent but not euphoric participation. The 4.7pp improvement over 5 days shows momentum without extremes.\n\n*Yield Environment:* 43bps 10Y-2Y spread maintains healthy steepness, indicating no immediate recession fears despite elevated absolute yield levels. This supports risk asset valuations.\n\n*Economic Backdrop:* Fed funds falling while CPI trends toward 3% creates policy complexity. The December 17 FOMC meeting becomes critical for direction.\n\n**NEWS SYNTHESIS:**\n\nCorporate earnings present a mixed picture - BMO showing strength while ADM cuts guidance on trade uncertainty. The stalled EU chip fab project highlights broader policy implementation challenges. Data center infrastructure investment continues but faces power grid constraints.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n\nThe -5% news risk adjustment reflects building policy uncertainty not yet captured in the complacent VIX. Trade tensions (ADM), industrial policy delays (EU chips), and Fed uncertainty create modest unpriced risk.\n\n**STRATEGIC POSITIONING:**\n\nThis environment favors selective positioning over broad beta exposure. Quality names with policy-insensitive business models should outperform. The combination of low VIX and elevated put/call suggests professional money is hedging while retail remains complacent - a setup that often resolves with modest volatility expansion.",
