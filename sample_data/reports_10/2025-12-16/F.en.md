**1. Gene Munster Says Ford's EV Pullback Could Be Beneficial For Tesla — Gary Black Says 'Ford Can't Make Money...'**
- Source: Benzinga | 20251216T060756 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management and Gary Black of The Future Fund LLC have commented on Ford Motor Co.'s recent EV pullback. Munster believes Ford's retreat from EVs will benefit Tesla, making it harder for Ford to build autonomous vehicles. Black suggests Ford's pivot to hybrids is an admission that it cannot profit from launching EV brand extensions of popular models like the F-150 Lightning, which Ford has now ceased production of.

**2. Ford to repurpose BlueOval SK Battery Park; 1,500 to lose jobs**
- Source: The Courier-Journal | 20251215T211012 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Ford Motor Co. is dramatically changing its electric vehicle strategy by converting its BlueOval SK Battery Park in Glendale, Kentucky, from an EV battery production facility to one that produces battery energy storage systems. This shift will result in the layoff of 1,500 current BlueOval SK employees, although Ford plans to hire 2,100 workers for the new business segment. The decision comes after Ford and SK On ended their joint EV battery venture and amid a reversal of federal support for the electric vehicle sector by the Trump administration.

**3. Ford to record $19.5 billion in special charges related to EV pullback**
- Source: CNBC | 20251215T210824 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Ford Motor expects to record approximately $19.5 billion in special charges, primarily in the fourth quarter, due to restructuring business priorities and scaling back its all-electric vehicle investments. This strategic shift includes refocusing on hybrid vehicles, canceling some large EV truck plans for smaller models, and rebalancing investments in core products like trucks and SUVs. Ford aims for profitability in its Model e electric vehicle business by 2029 and anticipates improving profits in traditional units, projecting 50% of its global volume to be hybrids, EREVs, and fully electric vehicles by 2030.

- Ford is reportedly halting production of its F-150 Lightning EV and shifting its financial strategy by $20 billion back towards gasoline and hybrid vehicles. This move indicates a significant change in the company's electric vehicle strategy as it re-evaluates its product focus.

**5. About 1,600 to be laid off as Ford repurposes BlueOval SK for energy storage in KY**
- Source: Lexington Herald Leader | 20251215T160800 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Ford Motor Co. plans to lay off about 1,600 Kentuckians as it repurposes its BlueOval SK facilities in Glendale, Kentucky, from electric vehicle battery manufacturing to producing energy storage systems for data centers and utility companies. This shift follows the dissolution of a joint venture with South Korean battery maker SK On and Ford's strategy to move into higher-return opportunities, including a $2 billion investment over two years in the new energy storage business. The laid-off workers will have the opportunity to apply for positions with the new Ford subsidiary.
