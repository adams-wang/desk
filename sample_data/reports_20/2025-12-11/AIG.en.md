**3. American International Group: Fairly Valued Even If Chubb M&A Rumors Don't Materialize**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251211T194039 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  Shares of American International Group (AIG) have performed strongly, partly due to rumors of an M&A bid from Chubb, which validates AIG's turnaround. While AIG's underwriting has improved with strong Q3 results and multi-year low combined ratios, regulatory hurdles make a deal unlikely, and further margin expansion appears challenging. Despite ongoing buybacks and a 2.2% yield, AIG is considered fairly valued with limited near-term upside, offering market-like returns without a clear catalyst.
