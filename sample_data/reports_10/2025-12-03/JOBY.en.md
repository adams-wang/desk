-  Goldman Sachs has initiated coverage on Joby Aviation Inc. (NYSE: JOBY) with a Sell rating and a $10.00 price target, citing valuation concerns despite the company's early-mover advantage in the eVTOL market. The firm questions whether Joby's lead in certification justifies its high Price/Book multiple and flags potential challenges in its multifaceted business model. While Joby boasts strong gross profit margins and a cash-rich balance sheet, it is not expected to achieve profitability this year.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
