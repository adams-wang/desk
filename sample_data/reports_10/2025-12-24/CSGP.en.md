- CoStar, a leading real estate analytics provider, has identified Richmond, VA, and Oklahoma City, OK, as the top-performing small-bay and big-box industrial markets in the U.S., respectively. Richmond excelled in the small-bay sector due to limited inventory growth and minimal vacancy expansion, while Oklahoma City led the big-box sector with healthy leasing activity and low availability rates for newer properties, largely driven by owner-users. The analysis considered factors like leasing activity, vacancy rates, inventory growth, and rent increases to determine market performance.

| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
