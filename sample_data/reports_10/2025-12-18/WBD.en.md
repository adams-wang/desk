**1. Warner Bros.: Endorsement of the Netflix Bid Is Unsurprising Amid Companies’ Posturing**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251217T182244 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Warner Bros. Discovery has urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance’s offer and instead support merging its streaming and studios business with Netflix. Morningstar believes the financial terms of both Netflix's and Paramount's bids are similar, making the likelihood of deal completion a key factor for shareholders. The company maintains its fair value estimates for Warner Bros., Paramount, and Netflix, and suggests Paramount is more likely to win with a potentially higher bid.

**2. Warner Bros. board tells shareholders to reject Paramount offer in favor of Netflix**
- Source: ABC News | 20251217T130839 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- The Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. board unanimously recommended shareholders reject Paramount Skydance’s acquisition bid, deeming it inadequate and risky. Instead, the board endorsed Netflix's earlier "superior" offer, which Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos welcomed as the best outcome for consumers, creators, and stockholders. Shares of Warner Bros. slipped, while Netflix stock climbed and Paramount's stock shed value following the announcement.

**3. Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's hostile bid, saying Netflix's offer is superior**
- Source: CBS News | 20251217T150809 | Neutral | Relevance: 94%
- Warner Bros. Discovery has advised shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, citing "significant risks and costs." The company argues that Netflix's earlier $82.7 billion offer for parts of Warner Bros. is financially superior and poses similar regulatory risks, while also highlighting concerns about Paramount Skydance's equity commitment and credit rating. This decision follows a competing bid from Paramount Skydance after Netflix's agreement to acquire HBO and other streaming businesses.

- Warner Bros. Discovery's board has unanimously rejected Paramount Skydance's $30/share acquisition offer, deeming it "inferior" to their existing Netflix merger agreement. WBD cited inadequate value, significant risks including an alleged lack of full financial backstop from the Ellison family, and unrealistic cost synergy targets as reasons for the rejection, reiterating commitment to the Netflix deal.

**5. Netflix Is '100% Committed' to Releasing Warner Bros. Movies in Theaters, Promises Company**
- Source: Nerdist | 20251217T151038 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 94%
- Netflix has publicly committed to releasing Warner Bros. films in theaters with "industry-standard windows" if its acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery is successful. This new stance comes after initial concerns that Netflix would shorten theatrical release windows, and is part of Netflix's latest letter to WBD stakeholders urging them to approve the merger over a competing bid from Paramount Skydance. The commitment aims to allay fears about the future of Warner Bros.' cinematic history under Netflix ownership.
