- Salesforce is relying on its Agentforce platform to boost revenue growth, which has slowed to single digits. Agentforce, which integrates AI across various core products, generated significant recurring revenues in Q3 fiscal 2026 and is central to Salesforce's strategy to reaccelerate growth despite competition from Microsoft and ServiceNow. While booking trends are encouraging and estimates show future revenue increases, the company's stock performance has lagged the industry year-to-date.
