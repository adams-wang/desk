- The iShares MSCI World ETF (URTH) has shown impressive performance in 2025, with a year-to-date return of over 20%. This growth is primarily driven by strong technology holdings and a rally in developed equity markets, supported by US policy and a weakening dollar. While US tech dominates its portfolio, URTH offers stable equity exposure for investors excluding emerging markets but carries a higher expense ratio than some competitors.
