**5. Is Slower Growth And Flat Margins Altering The Investment Case For Autodesk (ADSK)?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T023558 | Neutral | Relevance: 57%
- Autodesk (ADSK) has experienced 13.5% annual revenue growth over five years, but its growth rate lags behind its software peers, and operating margins have remained flat. This raises concerns about the company's ability to translate its market presence into improved profitability and the effectiveness of its sales and marketing spend. While AI-driven margin expansion is a key part of the investment thesis, current trends challenge the near-term narrative, though share repurchases aim to amplify future per-share improvements.
