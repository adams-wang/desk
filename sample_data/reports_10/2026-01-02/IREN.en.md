### Key Risks

1. High beta (4.24) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (16.0%, 1.3 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
4. Near-term weakness: 13.1% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_10 improving +5.0% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.05 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 40.3x stretched relative to 2% growth. Quality metrics strong (ROE 26%, margin 76%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (5.5x), low leverage (D/E 0.48). Revenue growth strong at 135% YoY. Institutional flow bullish (7 buying vs 3 selling).
