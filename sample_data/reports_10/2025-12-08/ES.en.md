-  Eversource Energy (ES) has seen a recent 9% share price pullback, prompting a reassessment of its valuation. Despite this, its year-to-date return remains positive, and analysts suggest the stock is about 8.2% undervalued, with a fair value estimate of $72.73.

One Springfield resident, Margaret Tebaldi, received an estimated bill of $720-$800 after a zero bill following a previous $200 charge, despite being on a fixed income.
