- Rockwell Automation's stock has been declining, leading to questions about whether the market is underestimating the industrial automation company or accurately pricing a slowdown. Despite recent weakness and a negative one-year performance, the company's long-term record, strategic shift to higher-margin software and services, and strong competitive position in industrial automation suggest it could be poised for a rebound. Wall Street analysts generally hold a "cautious hold" stance, recognizing near-term growth challenges but maintaining optimism for the long-term prospects tied to factory automation and digital transformation.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
