**1. Abivax Q3 Loss Widens, Operating Income Rises**
- Source: 富途牛牛 | 20251216T220843 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Abivax (ABVX) experienced a wider loss in Q3, although its operating income increased. The article mentions Unity Software's (U.US) fourth-quarter results, indicating revenues of $609 million, beating estimates, but reported a quarterly loss of 66 cents per share. This suggests the article might have conflated information or included a placeholder for Abivax's detailed Q3 results.

- Source: ts2.tech | 20251216T200843 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- ABIVAX Société Anonyme (ABVX) shares fell about 5% after its Q3 2025 financial results revealed widening losses, despite the company reiterating a strong cash runway into Q4 2027. The stock's pullback is attributed to profit-taking after a significant rally and the absence of new clinical data, with the market awaiting Phase 3 maintenance results in Q2 2026. Analysts maintain bullish ratings and price targets, with M&A speculation continuing to influence investor sentiment.

The company's operating loss increased to EUR 174.4 million, driven by higher research and development costs for its ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease clinical programs. Despite the increased expenses, a significant public offering in July 2025 boosted its cash reserves.

- French biotech company Abivax has seen its shares soar over 1,400% this year, making it Europe's best-performing stock, largely due to optimism surrounding its ulcerative colitis drug, obefazimod. Despite a widening net loss driven by trial costs, the company plans regulatory approval filings in 2026 and is the subject of takeover rumors, with Eli Lilly identified as a potential suitor. Abivax is also exploring market expansion and further trials for Crohn's disease, fueled by recent financing that secures operations until late 2027.
