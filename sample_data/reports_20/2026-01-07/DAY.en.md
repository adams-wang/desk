**1. Is Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Attractive After Recent Share Price Softness?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260107T111630 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- Automatic Data Processing (ADP) stock, currently trading at US$261.12, appears undervalued according to a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, which estimates its intrinsic value at $316.17 per share, suggesting a 17.4% discount. The company's P/E ratio of 25.53x also suggests an undervaluation when compared to its proprietary "Fair Ratio" of 30.26x. These metrics suggest that despite recent share price softness, ADP could be an attractive investment.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
