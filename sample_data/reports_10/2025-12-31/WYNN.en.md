- Morgan Stanley downgraded MGM China's stock rating from Overweight to Equal-weight due to anticipated higher royalty payments to its parent company, MGM Resorts International, which are expected to decrease future earnings. Despite MGM China's stock experiencing a significant single-day slump following news of the new branding agreement, MGM Resorts International posted gains.

The agreement, effective January 1, 2026, will run until Macau’s current gaming concession ends in 2032 and automatically extend further if new concessions are granted. Under the updated terms, MGM China will pay a higher monthly license fee, increasing to 3.5% of its adjusted consolidated net monthly revenue, with MGM Resorts receiving two-thirds of this fee.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
