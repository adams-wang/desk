Despite the breakthrough technology, Casgevy's revenue generation has been slow due to the complexity of its rollout and the profit-sharing agreement with partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals. This has led some to question the company's immediate investment potential, suggesting it might be considered "yesterday's news" by some investors.

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
