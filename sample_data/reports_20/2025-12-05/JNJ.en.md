- Johnson & Johnson MedTech is enacting an organizational restructuring set to begin in January 2026, shifting from a regional operating model to a business unit-led structure globally. This change, building on earlier decentralization efforts and coinciding with the separation of DePuy Synthes Orthopaedics, aims to enhance accountability, streamline decision-making, and increase competitiveness for its various units.
