- Several semiconductor stocks, including Himax, Intel, Marvell Technology, Allegro MicroSystems, and IPG Photonics, experienced declines following reports that China is prioritizing domestic AI chips for government procurement, shifting away from US technology. This move, part of China's "buy local" campaign, raises concerns about potential market share loss for American chipmakers. Marvell Technology, in particular, saw its shares drop further due to recent news about losing key custom chip design contracts and an analyst downgrade.
