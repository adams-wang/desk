- IBM has seen a 33% increase in its stock value over the past year, outperforming peers like Microsoft and Amazon, driven by strong demand for hybrid cloud and AI products. The company is benefiting from its watsonx platform, a focus on quantum computing through collaborations with Cisco, and positive estimate revisions, making it a potentially solid investment. Despite trading below the industry average in price/sales, it's above its mean, with analysts recommending a "Buy" based on its strong fundamentals and growth prospects.
