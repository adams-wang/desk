### Key Risks

1. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.5x requires aggressive growth execution.
2. Elevated short interest (14.7%): bears positioning against stock.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.50 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 17.2x stretched relative to 6% growth. Quality metrics strong (ROE 21%, margin 21%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (3.0x). Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 5 selling).

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
