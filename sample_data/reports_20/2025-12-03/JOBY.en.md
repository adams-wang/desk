- Goldman Sachs has initiated coverage on Joby Aviation Inc. (NYSE: JOBY) with a Sell rating and a $10.00 price target, citing valuation concerns despite the company's early-mover advantage in the eVTOL market. The firm questions whether Joby's lead in certification justifies its high Price/Book multiple and flags potential challenges in its multifaceted business model. While Joby boasts strong gross profit margins and a cash-rich balance sheet, it is not expected to achieve profitability this year.
