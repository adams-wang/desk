AT&T reiterated its full-year 2025 and multi-year guidance, including $4 billion in share repurchases in 2025 and an expected $20 billion repurchase capacity for 2025–2027.

**5. Netflix's Biggest Wall Street Backer Downgrades It on Warner Bros. Deal**
- Source: The Hollywood Reporter | 20251208T050400 | Neutral | Relevance: 64%
-  Netflix's biggest Wall Street backer, Pivotal Research Group, downgraded its rating on Netflix shares from "buy" to "hold" after the announced $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery’s studios and streaming operations. Analyst Jeff Wlodarczak expressed concern that the mega-transaction reflects Netflix's worry about growing audience engagement amidst the rise of short-form content platforms like YouTube and TikTok, hinting at an "expensive admission of long-form headwinds." This deal introduces risks such as regulatory approval, potential bidding wars, and highlights a fundamental shift in consumer attention spans away from long-form content.
