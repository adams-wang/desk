**1. What Falling Interest Rates Mean for KeyCorp's Net Interest Income**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20251231T163858 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- KeyCorp (KEY) has experienced volatility in its net interest income (NII), which declined in 2023 and 2024 but is projected to grow in 2025 due to lower deposit costs and asset repricing. Falling interest rates generally reduce bank earnings from loans, but they also stabilize funding costs and increase borrowing, which is expected to support NII growth for KeyCorp and its peers like Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) in the coming quarters. KeyCorp anticipates a 22% year-over-year rise in 2025 NII and expects its net interest margin (NIM) to improve significantly by the end of 2026.
