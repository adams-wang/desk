**1. Radware warns 2026 will mark rise of ‘Internet of Agents’**
- Source: SecurityBrief Asia | 20251215T040922 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Radware cybersecurity specialists predict that 2026 will see a significant shift towards an "Internet of Agents," where machine-to-machine activity, automated agents, and AI will dominate internet traffic, threat landscapes, and defense strategies. This shift will make APIs the primary attack surface and intensify AI-enhanced social engineering and denial-of-service attacks. Consequently, regulatory demands will tighten, and there will be a greater focus on zero-day vulnerabilities, runtime security, and machine identities for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity measures.
