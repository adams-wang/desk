  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (HIGH confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias and 100% max size. This aligns well with our OFFENSIVE rotation bias showing cyclicals (XLI, XLC) leading while defensives underperform.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nPre-calculated signals validated: 2 bullish (IGNITION, TREND), 3 neutral, 6 bearish including 1 TOXIC. No anomalies detected vs v6.1 thresholds.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: D (7 sectors), A (1), E (3), C (1). Clear rotation toward cyclicals with Industrials igniting and Communication Services trending. Defensive sectors concentrated in avoid/toxic zones.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo L1 vs L2 conflict - both show risk-on positioning. Defensive weakness despite NORMAL regime explained by early expansion cycle phase where growth sectors outperform safety.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nEARLY_EXPANSION identified based on Industrials leadership (classic early cycle behavior), Communication Services strength (growth sectors leading), and broad defensive sector weakness. This pattern typically occurs when economic growth accelerates but inflation/rate concerns remain muted, favoring cyclical growth over safety.\n\nKey Insight: Market is in textbook early expansion rotation with only 2 of 11 sectors showing bullish signals, indicating highly selective leadership rather than broad-based strength - focus on Industrials ignition and Communication Services trend continuation while avoiding the 6 sectors in deterioration."
