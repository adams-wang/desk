This downgrade follows several other analyst actions, including lowered price targets from firms like Wells Fargo and Jefferies, indicating investor attention should be paid to further developments.

- Wolfe Research has downgraded Mohawk Industries (NYSE:MHK) from Outperform to Peerperform, citing a normalized valuation relative to its peers. Although the anticipated recovery in repair and remodel volumes has not materialized, MHK's valuation discount has significantly narrowed since Wolfe's upgrade in January 2025. Mohawk has notably outperformed the Building Products sector since the upgrade, but future equity upside is expected to rely more on valuation improvement than earnings outperformance.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
