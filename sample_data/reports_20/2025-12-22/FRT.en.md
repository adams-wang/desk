- Federal Realty Investment Trust has sold Pallas at Pike & Rose, a 319-unit apartment building in North Bethesda, for $125 million to Bell Partners Inc.

**2. Agree Realty (ADC): Assessing Valuation After a 3.6% Annualized Dividend Increase**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251222T130934 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- Agree Realty (ADC) recently announced a 3.6% annualized dividend increase, bringing attention to its valuation. Despite trading below analyst targets and showing steady double-digit revenue and earnings growth, its high P/E ratio suggests a premium valuation compared to peers. The market's current assessment of ADC's future growth and e-commerce resistant tenant base is being scrutinized.

**3. Curbline Properties (CURB): Assessing Valuation After New Regular and Special Dividend Declarations**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251221T120910 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- Curbline Properties (CURB) recently declared a regular fourth-quarter dividend and a special dividend, signaling strong cash generation. While the company's valuation appears rich with a 60.1x P/E ratio, exceeding industry benchmarks, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model suggests it may be significantly undervalued by the market. This discrepancy highlights potential mispricing despite current earnings metrics.
