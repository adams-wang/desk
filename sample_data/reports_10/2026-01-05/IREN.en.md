### Key Risks

1. High beta (4.27) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.

3. High short interest (16.0%, 1.3 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_10 improving +16.1% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
