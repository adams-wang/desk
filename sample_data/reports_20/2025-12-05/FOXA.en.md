- Netflix has agreed to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's movie and television business and HBO Max for $72 billion, a deal that could reshape the media industry. The acquisition faces significant regulatory hurdles, with its approval likely hinging on how narrowly regulators define the competitive market in streaming and video content. Furthermore, a scorned rival, Paramount, and the influence of the Trump administration, are expected to challenge the transaction.
