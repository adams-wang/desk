- Source: ts2.tech | 20251210T100911 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- Quantum computing stocks, including IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti Computing (RGTI), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT), are showing subdued pre-market activity on December 10, 2025, despite significant insider selling warnings and bubble-like valuations. Analysts remain bullish for the long term, but massive insider selling and upcoming lock-up expirations, particularly for IonQ, raise concerns about potential selling pressure and inflated valuations heading into 2026. The market for these stocks is characterized by structural volatility, amplified by leveraged ETFs and active options trading, making them high-risk investments despite the long-term potential of quantum technology.

Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
