- CVS Health Corp. is facing investor skepticism as its stock slides amidst a pivot to value-based care, concerns over dividend stability, and mixed Wall Street signals. Despite a comprehensive strategy involving retail pharmacies, PBM, insurance, and newly acquired primary and home-care assets, the market remains unconvinced by the long-term transformation given execution risks and reimbursement pressures. While the company's valuation underpins a contrarian bull case due to a defensive model and strong cash flows, the market demands tangible evidence of margin protection and synergy harvesting to shift the bearish sentiment.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
