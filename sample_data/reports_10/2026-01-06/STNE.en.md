**1. How StoneCo’s R$1.95 Billion Share Buyback Will Impact StoneCo (STNE) Investors**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260104T230934 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- StoneCo recently completed a R$1.95 billion share buyback, repurchasing 8.27% of its Class A shares, as announced in May 2025. This action is expected to amplify earnings per share by reducing the share count. While it supports EPS, the company still faces challenges with moderating TPV growth and competition in Brazil's payments sector, alongside risks from rising credit provisions.
