**1. Verizon (VZ) Enhances Connectivity at Denver Broncos Stadium**
- Source: GuruFocus | 20251211T150920 | Bullish | Relevance: 99%
- Verizon Business has significantly upgraded the fan experience at Empower Field at Mile High, home of the Denver Broncos, by installing a new Wi-Fi 6E and Local Area Network with over 2,400 wireless access points. These enhancements improve stadium operations, fan safety, and enjoyment.
