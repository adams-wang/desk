### Key Risks

1. High beta (3.41) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation risk: PEG 3.1x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
3. Elevated short interest (10.9%): bears positioning against stock.
4. Long-term trend broken: trading 45.7% below SMA200.
5. Falling knife pattern: rapid decline without stabilization, catch risk elevated.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

PEG ratio 3.09 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (ROE 26%, ROA 17%, margin 1667%). Balance sheet: low leverage (D/E 0.27). Insider buying signal ($4.1M), management confidence. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX near 15th percentile of 52-week range signals calm conditions, while modest yield curve steepening (54bps 10Y-3M) suggests healthy growth expectations. Breadth at 52% indicates selective participation rather than broad-based momentum.*
