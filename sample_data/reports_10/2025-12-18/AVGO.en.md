- Major AI-related stocks like Broadcom, Super Micro Computer Inc, and Nvidia declined following a report that Amazon is in talks to invest up to $10 billion in OpenAI, with OpenAI potentially using Amazon Web Services' (AWS) Trainium chips.

Despite the dip, fund manager Ross Gerber views this as a buying opportunity for publicly traded AI stocks, noting their current "cheap" valuation.
