    - Summary: In December 2025, Charles Schwab's Schwab Trading Activity Index (STAX) eased to 48.48, indicating clients were net sellers across sectors due to year-end portfolio repositioning.

**Conflicts & Divergences**
- Put/Call ratio at 1.537 (extreme fear reading) conflicts sharply with VIX at 6th percentile - smart money hedging while vol is cheap?
- Venezuela military operation driving gold to near-records while equity VIX remains subdued - geopolitical risk not priced in equities
- Apple services slowdown signal vs. broad semiconductor/AI enthusiasm - potential divergence in tech leadership quality

**Positioning Guidance**
- Regime: RISK_ON (STABLE)
- Confidence: MEDIUM
- Position size: 110% max
- Key action: Maintain long exposure with quality bias; the put/call divergence and Venezuela situation warrant watchfulness but don't override constructive setup.

**Triggers**
- Upgrade: VIX sustained below 14 with put/call normalizing below 1.1, Venezuela situation de-escalates without broader conflict, Jobs report Friday confirms soft landing narrative
- Downgrade: Venezuela escalation draws broader international response, VIX spikes above 20 on geopolitical contagion, Put/call remains elevated as VIX rises (confirmation of hedging thesis), Breadth deteriorates below 50% on narrow leadership

**Risk Factors**
- Venezuela U.S. military intervention - unprecedented geopolitical risk with unclear escalation path
- Extreme put/call ratio (1.537) suggests institutional hedging despite calm VIX - potential leading indicator
- VIX near 52-week lows creates asymmetric risk (limited downside in vol, significant upside)
- Jobs report Friday (Jan 9) could disrupt Fed dovish narrative if hot
- Apple services weakness may signal broader consumer/tech spending concerns
