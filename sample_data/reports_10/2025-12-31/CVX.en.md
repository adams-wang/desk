**1. Chevron stock price today: CVX edges up after hours as oil steadies and Tengiz export risks linger**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251231T000846 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Chevron Corporation (CVX) shares rose 0.9% in after-hours trading, reaching $152.31, as oil prices remained stable despite lingering geopolitical concerns and risks to Tengiz oil exports from Kazakhstan. Investors are closely monitoring the impact of a Ukrainian drone attack on the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's Black Sea export terminal, which has led to a significant drop in Tengiz production and CPC route exports. The company's next earnings report is anticipated around January 30th.

**2. First oil at new platform is major milestone for Chevron in Angola**
- Source: euro-petrole.com | 20251230T093900 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Chevron has achieved first oil from its new South N'dola Platform in Angola's Block 0, a significant milestone for the company which has operated in Angola for over 70 years. This new platform utilizes existing infrastructure, connecting to the Mafumeira facility for processing, thereby optimizing cost-efficiency. The South N'dola project is expected to create jobs and contribute to Angola's energy output, reinforcing Chevron's long-standing partnership with the Angolan government.

**3. Chevron stock today: CVX closes higher as oil jumps and $120 million Frontera deal hits tape**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251230T014123 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Chevron shares rose 0.7% to $150.99 as oil prices gained over 2% due to geopolitical tensions and supply concerns. Frontera Energy announced a two-year crude-supply prepayment deal worth up to $120 million with a Chevron unit, with an initial $80 million advance. Kazakh oil output, largely from the Chevron-led Tengiz field, fell by 6% in early December due to export constraints at the Caspian Pipeline Consortium's Black Sea terminal.

**4. Chevron stock edges up as oil rallies and Frontera signs $120 mln supply deal**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251229T190809 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Chevron shares rose following a rally in oil prices and news that Frontera Energy signed a two-year prepayment deal worth up to $120 million to supply crude to Chevron Products Company. Geopolitical supply risks, particularly from Kazakhstan where there was a 6% output drop in December, also contributed to the rise. This comes as the energy sector navigates debates over potential oil oversupply in 2026, which could impact prices and margins.

**5. Chevron stock on watch as oil climbs late Sunday ahead of U.S. open**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251229T041750 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Chevron stock is under observation as oil prices, particularly Brent and U.S. WTI crude futures, rose almost 0.9% late Sunday due to renewed Middle East tensions. This surge sets the stage for Chevron Corp's performance as U.S. equity trading resumes on Monday, following a Friday slide influenced by global supply glut fears and Russia-Ukraine peace talks. Traders will monitor whether these geopolitical developments sustain the oil price rally and Chevron's stock movement into the new trading week.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
