**1. Ford US sales down slightly in November as EVs drag**
- Source: Reuters | 20251202T153500 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Ford Motor Co. experienced a marginal drop in its U.S. auto sales in November, primarily due to a significant decrease in electric vehicle sales. This decline is attributed to the cessation of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases and production issues stemming from a fire at a key aluminum supplier. Overall sales for the automaker slipped nearly 1% compared to the previous year.

**2. Ford, Hyundai sales slip in Nov. as EVs slide again; Kia volume up 2.6%**

- Ford and Hyundai experienced a slip in U.S. sales in November, primarily due to a decline in EV demand and weaker car sales. However, Kia's volume saw a 2.6% increase, and Hyundai's core crossover sales rose by 10% or more. The overall U.S. light-vehicle sales are predicted to drop for the second consecutive month.

**3. Ford November sales dip after aluminum plant fires, EV tax credit end**
- Source: The Detroit News | 20251202T050000 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Ford Motor Co.'s U.S. sales declined by almost 1% year-over-year in November, primarily due to an aluminum shortage affecting F-Series production and a significant 61% drop in electric vehicle sales following the end of the federal plug-in vehicle tax credit. Sales of F-Series pickups, Ford's profit engine, fell 9.6%, while EV models like the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E saw substantial decreases. The company plans to make up for lost production and launch a next-generation electric full-size pickup in 2028, amidst a broader industry slowdown and political shifts against EV mandates.

**4. Over 20,000 Ford vehicles recalled due to battery issue. See impacted models.**
- Source: USA Today | 20251202T035353 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Ford is recalling over 20,000 vehicles, including 2021-2024 Lincoln Corsair plug-in hybrids and 2020-2024 Ford Escape PHEVs, due to a battery issue that could lead to fires or crashes. The problem stems from high-voltage battery cells that may experience internal short-circuiting, causing the propulsion system to shut down and potentially resulting in battery thermal venting. Ford has not determined the exact cause but suggests previous damage to the battery pack cell's separator layer, and is recommending customers limit charging and use "Auto EV" mode until a free remedy is provided.
