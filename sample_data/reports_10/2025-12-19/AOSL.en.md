- Alpha and Omega Semiconductor (NASDAQ:AOSL) appears to have a healthy balance sheet, boasting a net cash position of US$218.7m as of September 2025, which comfortably offsets its total liabilities. While the company reported an EBIT loss and negative free cash flow over the last year, its robust cash reserves are sufficient to cover current spending for over two years. This financial strength suggests a conservative and safe approach to debt management, despite slower revenue growth.
