- Lucid Group (LCID) stock has fallen to a new 52-week low of $11.46, marking a 58.24% decline over the past year due to market pressures and investor concerns.

- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251216T185400 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Lucid Group (LCID) has been upgraded to a "Buy" due to improved liquidity, extending through Q1 2027 with $5.5 billion in capacity, and reduced FY25 capital expenditure forecasts.
