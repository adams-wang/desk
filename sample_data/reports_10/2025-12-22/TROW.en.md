- Source: T. Rowe Price | 20251222T220903 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- T. Rowe Price's Asset Allocation Committee is maintaining a neutral risk posture while adjusting its allocation mix, specifically by shifting capital from core large-cap equities into a barbell of U.S. value and U.S. growth with a modest tilt towards small-cap growth. The committee is positioned for broader equity market performance and favors inflation-linked bonds due to upside risks to inflation, despite strong S&P 500 earnings and AI spending. However, concerns about high market concentration, crowded risk assets, and high-quality U.S. large-cap valuations are significant factors influencing their strategy.
