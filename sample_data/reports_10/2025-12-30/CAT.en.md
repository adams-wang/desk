- Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) stock slipped slightly in after-hours trading, with investors continuing to focus on the growing demand for on-site generators driven by AI data centers. A recent SEC filing also noted additional phantom stock units credited to CEO Joseph Creed. The stock's performance this year has been significantly influenced by both traditional construction/mining demand and new power equipment needs for AI infrastructure, making it sensitive to power demand trends and interest rate changes.

- Bernstein has raised its price target on Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) to $630 from $557, maintaining a Market Perform rating, and anticipates a recovery in 2026 driven by tighter alignment between monetary and fiscal policy. While the firm expects low- to mid-single-digit upside, a recent Bloomberg report highlighted investor questions regarding the durability of Caterpillar's AI-driven rally, which had caused a 9.6% stock drop over five sessions, though it has since rebounded. The company's unexpected AI link stems from its sales of gas turbines used to power data centers, which, combined with lower interest rates, fueled a significant stock rise, pushing its valuation to 28 times forward earnings.

(NYSE: CAT) to $630 from $557, maintaining a Market Perform rating, and anticipates a recovery for the sector in 2026 driven by tighter monetary and fiscal policy alignment. The firm expects positive estimate revisions and low- to mid-single-digit upside.

- Caterpillar shares experienced a slight dip despite strong demand for its generators, driven by AI data centers, and expansion plans.

An SEC filing also revealed CEO Joe Creed acquired "phantom stock units."
