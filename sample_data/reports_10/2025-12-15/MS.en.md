- Morgan Stanley projects that gold prices will reach $4,800 an ounce by the fourth quarter of 2026, driven by anticipated rate cuts, a weaker dollar, and strong Chinese retail demand. However, the bank expects slower gains in 2026 due to reduced purchases by central banks and exchange-traded funds.

This move, aimed at supporting struggling sectors, could inadvertently lead to an "asset bubble" and an inflated stock market, according to Morgan Stanley's current expectations. Wilson notes that earnings growth for median S&P companies is rising, providing a backdrop against which further rate cuts risk creating an over-inflated equities market.
