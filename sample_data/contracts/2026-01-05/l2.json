This four-sector offensive cluster (XLE/XLI/XLF/XLB) captures 36% of sector universe but represents the entire bullish cohort\u2014a concentrated leadership pattern typical of early cycle phases.\n\nThe middle tier (XLY/XLK/XLRE/XLU in Zone E) shows consolidation rather than deterioration\u2014Technology maintains innovation leadership (NVIDIA Alpamayo, HP AI PCs) but rotates capital to cyclicals.

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (HIGH confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 regime: NORMAL (STABLE) with AGGRESSIVE bias, 115% max sizing. VIX calm (14.9), positive yield curve (+65bps), healthy breadth (59.2%). Elevated put/call (1.27) = institutional hedging but NOT blocking risk-on. L2 rotation: Offensive cyclicals (XLE/XLI/XLF/XLB) leading, defensives (XLP/XLV/XLC) lagging. FULL ALIGNMENT\u2014cyclical outperformance implements AGGRESSIVE mandate. Put/call divergence explains superinvestor defensive accumulation (ELV) as hedge, not contradiction. No hard blocks.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nPre-calculated signals validated against v7.0 rules: Zone F (XLE MRS_20=+4.44%, XLB +3.19%) \u2192 MOMENTUM confirmed. Zone A (XLI +2.35%, XLF +2.47% with MRS_5 >0) \u2192 TREND confirmed. Zone E (XLY/XLK/XLRE/XLU all -0.5% to +0.5%) \u2192 NEUTRAL confirmed. Zone B (XLC +0.65%, XLV +0.55% with MRS_5 <0) \u2192 WEAKENING confirmed. Zone C (XLP -1.07%) \u2192 AVOID confirmed. No anomalies detected. Signal distribution: 2 MOMENTUM, 2 TREND, 4 NEUTRAL, 2 WEAKENING, 1 AVOID = 11 sectors accounted. Modifiers: F/A zones = 1.2x, E = 1.0x, B = 0.75x, C = 0.5x per spec.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: F (Energy, Materials), A (Industrials, Financials), E (4 sectors: Cyclical/Tech/RE/Utilities), B (Communication, Healthcare), C (Staples). Rotation direction: OFFENSIVE\u2014capital flowing FROM Zone C/B defensives TO Zone F/A cyclicals. Zone F dominance (XLE +4.44% highest MRS_20) anchors momentum. Zone A sustained trends provide stability. Zone E consolidation (not deterioration) in Tech/RE shows rotation pause, not breakdown. Zone B early warnings in XLC/XLV (MRS_5 turning negative) = defensive exodus. Zone C toxic XLP = ultimate risk-off rejection. Clear gradient from offensive (F/A) \u2192 neutral (E) \u2192 defensive deterioration (B/C).\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo L1 vs L2 conflict exists\u2014both signal risk-on. Potential surface conflict: L1 elevated put/call (1.27) vs L2 aggressive rotation. Resolution: Put/call reflects INSTITUTIONAL hedging (smart money buying portfolio insurance) while DEPLOYING capital offensively, NOT retail fear. News context confirms: superinvestors (Greenberg, Klarman, Grantham) accumulating quality defensive ELV = hedge positioning, while M&A wave ($13B+) and energy rally = offensive deployment. This is SOPHISTICATED risk management (hedge + deploy), not contradiction. Narrative: 'Energy Security' regime shift (news: supply constraints, AI power demand, OPEC+ discipline) drives XLE leadership. Industrial M&A ($8.8B BlueScope, $4.2B GATX, defense tech) validates XLI. Critical minerals (lithium 92.9% extraction) supports XLB. Financials benefit from M&A advisory/lending. Defensives (XLP/XLV/XLC) abandoned as economic acceleration reduces safe-haven demand.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nEARLY_EXPANSION identification stems from textbook cyclical leadership pattern: Industrials and Financials in sustained uptrends (Zone A TREND), Energy and Materials showing momentum breakouts (Zone F MOMENTUM), while defensive Consumer Staples deteriorates into Zone C TOXIC.
