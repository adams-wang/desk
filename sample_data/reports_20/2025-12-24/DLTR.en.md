- The 2026 fiscal year will be a "prove-it" year for Starbucks, Chipotle, and Dollar Tree as they navigate a consumer landscape marked by inflation fatigue and selective spending. Each company has unique strategies: Starbucks with a "Back to Starbucks" operational renaissance, Chipotle with automation-led expansion, and Dollar Tree with a leaner, post-divestiture "multi-price" model. The success of these initiatives will dictate their market leadership in the coming decade, with potential winners and losers emerging based on efficiency, perceived value, and ability to adapt to a "barbell economy" where consumers demand both ultra-low cost and "worth-it" experiences.

| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
