**1. VeriSign, Inc. (VRSN): A Bear Case Theory**
- Source: Finviz | 20251204T135900 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- This article presents a bear case theory for VeriSign, Inc. (VRSN), citing structural pressures in its core .Com domain business. Despite recent stock gains driven by high-churn registrars and aggressive rebate programs, the underlying growth is deemed unsustainable due to declining renewal rates, plummeting parking revenue following a Google ban, and a broader market rationalization. These factors are expected to lead to negative net .Com domain growth and revenue pressure in FY2026, posing a significant near-term risk for investors.
