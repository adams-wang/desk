**1. The Bull Case For Molson Coors (TAP) Could Change Following Madrí Excepcional’s £1 Billion Breakout - Learn Why**
- Source: Sahm | 20251210T130903 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- Molson Coors' (TAP) Madrí Excepcional lager has achieved £1 billion in annual sales in the UK, becoming the second-largest world lager brand just five years after launch. While this highlights strength in premium and low/no-alcohol offerings, the company recently lowered its 2025 net sales guidance, indicating that individual product successes may not immediately overcome broader market headwinds or cost pressures. Investors are urged to consider multiple perspectives on the company's long-term earnings power, given contrasting views on its fair value.
