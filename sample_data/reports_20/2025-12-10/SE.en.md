**3. Does SE's Heavy Free Fire Dependence Pose a Risk to Garena's Growth?**
- Source: Nasdaq | 20251208T160959 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- Sea Limited's Garena unit, despite strong financial results driven by Free Fire, faces risks due to its over-reliance on a single title. While in-game collaborations have boosted revenue, growth is primarily from higher spending per user, while player growth remains limited. This concentration, coupled with intense competition from major gaming companies like Take-Two Interactive and Roblox, poses potential long-term challenges for Garena's growth and diversification.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
