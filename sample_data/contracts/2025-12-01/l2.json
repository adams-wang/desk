  "cycle_reasoning": "Classified as EARLY_EXPANSION based on Technology ignition signal and commodity sector strength, but confidence remains LOW due to mixed cyclical participation.

Technology leading from oversold levels suggests risk appetite returning, while Energy and Materials maintaining trends indicates commodity strength. However, the failure of traditionally cyclical sectors like Industrials to participate, combined with defensive Consumer Staples outperforming, suggests market uncertainty. The weakening in Healthcare and Communication Services, despite their defensive characteristics, indicates sector-specific headwinds rather than broad risk-off sentiment.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (LOW confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 regime is NORMAL (STABLE) with AGGRESSIVE bias. Our sector rotation shows mixed signals with both offensive (XLK, XLE) and defensive (XLP) leadership, which partially aligns with aggressive positioning but suggests market uncertainty.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nPre-calculated signals validated: 1 IGNITION, 3 TREND, 2 NEUTRAL, 2 WEAKENING, 3 AVOID. No anomalies detected vs empirical thresholds. Signal distribution suggests balanced but cautious market.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: Zone A (3 sectors - XLE, XLP, XLB trending), Zone D (4 sectors - XLK igniting, XLI/XLRE/XLU avoiding), Zone E (2 sectors - XLY/XLF neutral), Zone B (2 sectors - XLC/XLV weakening). Mixed rotation pattern.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nMinor conflict: L1 AGGRESSIVE bias vs mixed sector signals. Resolved by focusing on quality leadership in XLK ignition and energy/materials strength. News context supports selective risk-taking in technology and commodities while avoiding rate-sensitive sectors.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nClassified as EARLY_EXPANSION based on Technology ignition signal and commodity sector strength, but confidence remains LOW due to mixed cyclical participation. Traditional early-cycle leaders like Industrials are failing to ignite, while defensive sectors maintain relative strength, suggesting an incomplete or hesitant cycle transition.\n\nKey Insight: Technology's ignition signal from deeply oversold levels represents the most compelling opportunity, as it combines technical reversal with fundamental AI infrastructure tailwinds, while rate-sensitive sectors remain structurally challenged in current environment."
