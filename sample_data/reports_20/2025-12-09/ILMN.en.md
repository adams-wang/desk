|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX remains in the mid-range, breadth is moderate, and yield curve is flat but not inverted—indicating standard late-cycle conditions. Upbeat earnings and positive tech momentum are offset by cautious guidance in consumer sectors, suggesting selective positioning is favored.*
