**3. Truist analyst lowers Caesars and MGM earnings outlook because of latest Las Vegas revenue and visitation**
- Source: CDC Gaming | 20260105T171425 | Neutral | Relevance: 64%
- A Truist analyst has revised down his earnings outlook for MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment through 2027, citing recent declines in Las Vegas Strip gaming revenue and visitation figures. This adjustment reflects a more conservative view on the Strip's growth prospects, although both companies are still considered inexpensive. The outlook points to softness in revenue per room, average daily room rates, and overall visitation to Las Vegas.

**4. MGM Resorts extends branding partnership with MGM China**
- Source: Yogonet | 20260105T150426 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- MGM Resorts International has extended its branding agreement with MGM China Holdings Limited, effective January 1, 2026, increasing the monthly license fee from 1.75% to 3.5% of MGM China's adjusted consolidated net monthly revenues. This long-term agreement secures the MGM brand for MGM China through 2032 and potentially until 2045, safeguarding a key intangible asset. While beneficial for MGM Resorts and Pansy Ho, some analysts project a short-term negative impact on MGM China's EBITDA due to the doubled fees.
