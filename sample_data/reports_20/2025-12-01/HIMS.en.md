### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.41) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Heavy insider selling: $13M sold (25 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation risk: PEG 5.2x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
4. High short interest (36.6%, 2.6 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
5. Long-term trend broken: trading 19.4% below SMA200.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 5.23 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (ROE 26%). Insider selling cluster ($13.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (10 buying vs 0 selling).
