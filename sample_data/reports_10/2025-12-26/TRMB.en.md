- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251227T130851 | Neutral | Relevance: 55%
- Geospace Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:GEOS) has seen a significant 55% share price surge over the last month, contributing to a 71% annual gain. Despite a high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2x compared to an industry average of 1.1x, the market appears to be optimistic due to the company's strong medium-term revenue growth. While recent annual revenue declined by 18%, the three-year revenue growth of 24% is more attractive than the industry's one-year forecast of 2.6%, which likely justifies the elevated P/S ratio.
