**1. Is Clorox Offering Value After a 35% Slide and DCF Upside in 2025?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251204T125426 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Clorox has seen a 35% year-to-date stock slide, prompting questions about its valuation. A Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Clorox is significantly undervalued by over 50.8%, estimating its intrinsic value at approximately $213.56 per share compared to its current price around $105. However, its Price to Earnings (PE) ratio of 16.2x is very close to its proprietary Fair Ratio of 16.1x, indicating the market is pricing it in line with its fundamentals based on this metric.

- Source: MarketBeat | 20251204T220828 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%

**3. Norges Bank Makes New Investment in The Clorox Company $CLX**
- Source: MarketBeat | 20251203T121232 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Norges Bank has made a significant new investment in The Clorox Company, purchasing over 1.5 million shares valued at approximately $190.4 million during Q2, representing about 1.29% of the company. This comes as Clorox reported Q2 earnings of $0.85 EPS, exceeding expectations, but with an 18.9% revenue decline year-over-year and forward guidance below analyst estimates. The company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.24, resulting in a 4.7% yield, while analysts generally hold a "Reduce" rating with an average target price of $125.69.

**4. Korea Investment CORP Grows Stake in The Clorox Company $CLX**
- Source: MarketBeat | 20251202T110417 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Korea Investment CORP significantly increased its stake in The Clorox Company by 324.7% in Q2 2025, now owning 117,570 shares valued at approximately $14.12 million. Despite this increased institutional interest, analysts have recently issued "Reduce" ratings with an average price target of $125.69, following mixed Q3 results where EPS beat estimates but revenue declined. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of $1.24 per share.

**5. Clorox: A Dividend Champion Facing Headwinds, But Still A Buy (NYSE:CLX)**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251202T093900 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Clorox is positioned as a market leader with a 48-year dividend growth streak and a nearly 5% yield. Despite recent setbacks like revenue declines due to an ERP transition, cyberattack, and inflation, the company's IGNITE plan aims for 3-5% sales growth and improved margins. With acceptable dividend safety metrics and an undervaluation at ~$108/share compared to a fair value of $119.80, Clorox is recommended as a buy for dividend growth portfolios.
