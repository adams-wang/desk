- Pfizer and Astellas secured FDA approval for PADCEV/Keytruda as a perioperative treatment for cisplatin-ineligible muscle-invasive bladder cancer, enhancing Pfizer’s oncology portfolio. This approval strengthens Pfizer's oncology investment narrative, though overall expectations for the company remain balanced due to upcoming patent expirations, pricing pressures, and high debt. Despite this win, investors also weigh Metsera acquisition, cost-cutting, and elevated dividends against earnings dilution and leverage.
