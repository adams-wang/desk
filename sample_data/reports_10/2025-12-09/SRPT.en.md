- Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) recently achieved two clinical milestones: FDA approval for Cohort 8 dosing in its ENDEAVOR gene therapy study and progress in its SRP 1003 RNA program for myotonic dystrophy. Despite a recent 1-month share price return of 19.23%, the company has experienced a significant 82.63% decline in total shareholder return over the past year. While one valuation model suggests the stock is overvalued by 11.8%, another discounted cash flow model indicates it is deeply discounted, implying potential market overreaction to near-term risks.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251209T100905 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  Sarepta Therapeutics saw a 6.8% stock increase after the FDA approved dosing in Cohort 8 of its ENDEAVOR trial for ELEVIDYS in non-ambulant Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. This regulatory step is crucial for expanding ELEVIDYS's use beyond ambulant patients while managing safety concerns like liver injury. The company faces an investment narrative challenged by these safety concerns, impacting uptake and revenue timing, but the Cohort 8 approval offers a positive direction for label expansion efforts.
