- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T100836 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Intuit Inc.'s high P/E ratio of 42.5x, significantly above the market average, is justified by its impressive past and projected future earnings growth. With EPS growth of 41% last year and an estimated 16% annual growth over the next three years (compared to the market's 11%), investors are willing to pay a premium for the stock. This strong growth expectation and investor confidence in future earnings stability are the primary reasons not to be concerned about its share price.

**5. Why We're Not Concerned About Intuit Inc.'s (NASDAQ:INTU) Share Price**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T100824 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Intuit Inc.'s (NASDAQ:INTU) P/E ratio of 42.5x is much higher than the market average in the US, where half of companies have P/E ratios below 19x. However, the company's strong earnings growth of 41% last year and an estimated 16% annual growth over the next three years, compared to the market's 11%, justifies this premium. Investors are comfortable with the high P/E due to the expectation of continued strong future earnings, supporting the share price.

| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
