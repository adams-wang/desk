- Cardinal Health (CAH) has exceeded revenue expectations, leading to a strong stock performance with a 32.71% return in 90 days and a 334.33% total shareholder return over five years. The company is currently considered modestly undervalued with a narrative fair value near $216.60 against a closing price of $205.20, driven by growth in healthcare services, though tighter drug pricing regulations could pose risks.
