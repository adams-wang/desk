2. Elevated short interest (13.4%): bears positioning against stock.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 3.92 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 17.5x stretched relative to 6% growth. Quality metrics strong (ROE 21%, margin 21%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (3.0x). Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 5 selling).

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite persisting. Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
