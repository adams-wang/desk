This mixed leadership reflects market uncertainty ahead of Fed decision, with investors hedging between defensive recovery plays and momentum cyclicals. The 4-sector TREND cluster (XLB, XLP, XLI, XLC) provides stability, while Technology's negative momentum stands out as the primary laggard. Rotation velocity is MODERATE with no crossover alerts, suggesting measured repositioning rather than aggressive sector swaps.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: CONTRACTION (MEDIUM confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias aligns well with sector rotation showing 8 bullish sectors (IGNITION/TREND/MOMENTUM signals). Mixed defensive/offensive leadership supports moderate risk appetite ahead of Fed decision.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll v6.1 signals validated against MRS thresholds. IGNITION signals (XLRE, XLU) show proper Zone D + positive MRS_5. TREND signals (XLB, XLP, XLI, XLC) in Zone A. MOMENTUM signals (XLF, XLY) in Zone F. NEUTRAL signals (XLV, XLE, XLK) appropriately in Zone E.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: D (2 sectors - defensive recovery), A (4 sectors - sustained trends), F (2 sectors - strong momentum), E (3 sectors - neutral/noise). Rotation direction is MIXED with both defensive and offensive sectors showing strength.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo L1 vs L2 conflicts. NORMAL regime supports current mixed rotation pattern. News context shows M&A activity, analyst upgrades, and Fed uncertainty creating selective sector performance rather than broad directional moves.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nCONTRACTION phase identified with MEDIUM confidence based on defensive sectors (Real Estate, Utilities) leading recovery from oversold levels while traditional late-cycle sectors (Financials) maintain momentum. Healthcare and Technology showing neutral/weak performance typical of cycle transition periods. Mixed defensive/offensive leadership pattern suggests economy in transition phase.\n\nKey Insight: Market is exhibiting a rare defensive-led recovery with Real Estate and Utilities igniting from oversold levels while Financials maintain momentum leadership - this mixed rotation pattern suggests investors are positioning for both Fed policy uncertainty and potential economic transition, creating opportunities in both defensive recovery plays and momentum cyclicals."
