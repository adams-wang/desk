### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.92) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Heavy insider selling: $145M sold (29 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 9.9x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. High short interest (21.4%, 1.2 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

Analyst sentiment positive (1 raises, avg +50%). Insider selling cluster ($145.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
