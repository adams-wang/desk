- Former FirstEnergy CEO Chuck Jones and Senior Vice President Michael Dowling are requesting access to grand jury testimony from an Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation agent, Eric Lehnhart, who was the primary investigator in their bribery case. Lehnhart is currently under internal investigation for allegedly providing "materially false or misleading" information in another case, leading the executives to believe similar misconduct may have occurred in their own proceedings. They argue that reviewing Lehnhart's testimony is crucial for a fair trial, especially since their trial is set to begin next month and his potential wrongdoing could compromise the integrity of the evidence against them.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
