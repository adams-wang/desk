While a narrative places its fair value at $19.53, suggesting it's undervalued due to its focus on experiential retail, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model indicates a much stronger undervaluation, with an estimated fair value of $31, implying investors may be underestimating its earning potential. However, high leverage and exposure to challenging mall markets pose risks to its valuation upside.
