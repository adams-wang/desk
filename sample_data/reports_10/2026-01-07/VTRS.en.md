- The WisdomTree U.S. MidCap Dividend Fund (DON) delivered a 70% return over five years and pays monthly dividends, holding about 400 mid-cap dividend stocks with a 2.45% yield. While it boasts diversification and a focus on mid-cap value, some top holdings exhibit stretched payout ratios which raises concerns about dividend sustainability. Despite trailing the S&P 500's total return, DON offers higher current income and lower concentration risk, positioning it as a steady income option for investors.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
