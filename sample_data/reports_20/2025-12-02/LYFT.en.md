3. High short interest (16.7%, 3.6 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 5 raises (avg +32%) could attract flows.
- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +9.3% over 5 days suggests accumulation.

Insider selling cluster ($3.6M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 5 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -7.8% to 1.6% (+9.3% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 2.5pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 at 5.7% confirms short-term momentum alignment. AM_20 at 3.3% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI neutral at 57. Volume at 55% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | IGNITION (Zone D) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
