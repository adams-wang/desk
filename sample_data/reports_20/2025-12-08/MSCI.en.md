- Source: Bitcoin Magazine | 20251208T184752 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
-  Bitcoin For Corporations (BFC), in coordination with its member companies, formally challenged MSCI’s proposed rule to exclude companies from global indexes if digital assets represent 50% or more of total assets. The coalition argues that this proposal misclassifies operating companies by prioritizing balance-sheet holdings over actual business operations, creating potential negative impacts like passive fund outflows and increased volatility. Strive Asset Management, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, echoed this sentiment, arguing against the 50% threshold for bitcoin holdings, citing inconsistency with accounting standards and the operational nature of many bitcoin treasury companies.
