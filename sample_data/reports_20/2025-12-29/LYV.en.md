- California is challenging Live Nation's alleged monopoly, which controls a significant portion of the primary ticketing market, numerous venues, and promotional aspects of live entertainment. Lawsuits from California's Attorney General and the Justice Department argue that Live Nation's practices harm artists, venues, and fans through inflated prices, anticompetitive contracts, and unchecked scalping. The legal actions aim to restore competition, lower fees, and make concert and sports tickets more affordable for consumers.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
