  "cycle_reasoning": "EARLY_EXPANSION classification is supported by Consumer Cyclical leadership, moderate risk appetite, and the beginning of defensive sector underperformance. The pattern shows initial economic optimism with selective sector participation, typical of early cycle phases where growth expectations improve but haven't yet reached full momentum.",
  "rotation_analysis": "The sector rotation pattern reveals a cautious risk-on environment with Consumer Cyclical (XLY) emerging as the sole leader in Zone A with TREND signal. The concentration of 8 sectors in Zone E (noise range) suggests a consolidation phase rather than aggressive rotation. Energy (XLE) shows promising short-term momentum despite neutral positioning, while Technology (XLK) benefits from AI themes and rate cut expectations. The weakness in rate-sensitive sectors (XLRE, XLU) confirms the market's anticipation of Fed policy shifts. The absence of strong defensive leadership indicates investors are moving away from safety trades but not yet fully embracing high-beta cyclicals.",
  "l1_alignment": "Sector rotation aligns well with L1's NORMAL (IMPROVING) regime. The Consumer Cyclical leadership and defensive sector weakness support the moderately constructive macro conditions. The NEUTRAL rotation bias matches L1's cautious optimism, while the concentration in noise range reflects the selective participation noted in L1's 51% breadth reading.",
  "key_insight": "The market is in a selective risk-on transition with Consumer Cyclical leading while most sectors consolidate in noise range, suggesting early-stage economic optimism that hasn't yet broadened into full cyclical momentum - a classic early expansion setup that favors quality growth over defensive positioning.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (HIGH confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows NORMAL (IMPROVING) regime with moderately constructive conditions. Sector rotation aligns with Consumer Cyclical leadership and defensive weakness supporting the improving risk appetite narrative.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll pre-calculated signals validated against thresholds. XLY in Zone A with positive momentum generates TREND signal. XLRE and XLU in Zone D with negative momentum generate AVOID signals. Eight sectors in Zone E generate NEUTRAL signals as expected.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nZone distribution: A(1), E(8), D(2). Single Zone A leader (XLY) with broad Zone E consolidation and two Zone D laggards (XLRE, XLU). Rotation direction is mildly risk-on with rate-sensitive sectors underperforming.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo L1 vs L2 conflicts. Both levels indicate improving but cautious conditions. News themes of Fed dovish pivot, consumer strength, and defensive fade support the rotation pattern and align with macro regime assessment.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nEARLY_EXPANSION classification is supported by Consumer Cyclical leadership, moderate risk appetite, and the beginning of defensive sector underperformance. The pattern shows initial economic optimism with selective sector participation, typical of early cycle phases where growth expectations improve but haven't yet reached full momentum.\n\nKey Insight: The market is in a selective risk-on transition with Consumer Cyclical leading while most sectors consolidate in noise range, suggesting early-stage economic optimism that hasn't yet broadened into full cyclical momentum - a classic early expansion setup that favors quality growth over defensive positioning."
