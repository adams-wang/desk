Following a reversal of previous restrictions and recent political developments in Venezuela, Chevron is now uniquely positioned to expand its operations. This advantage stems from a long-term strategy and recent lobbying efforts.

- As ações da Chevron e de refinarias americanas subiram significativamente após declarações de Donald Trump indicando que os EUA buscavam "acesso total" às reservas de petróleo da Venezuela, alimentando a especulação de um relaxamento das restrições. A Chevron (NYSE: CVX) e empresas como Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) e Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) registraram fortes ganhos pré-mercado. No entanto, analistas alertam que uma recuperação substancial na produção venezuelana será gradual devido à incerteza política e infraestrutura deteriorada.

**5. Chevron, US oil stocks jump after Trump's Venezuela comments**

- Shares of U.S. oil companies, most notably Chevron Corp., saw a significant jump in premarket trading after President Donald Trump's comments about the U.S. planning to "run" Venezuela.

*RISK_ON regime with strong participation and low volatility. VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) with breadth at 63.5% signals healthy risk appetite. Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
