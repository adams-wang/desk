-  Fitch Ratings has affirmed Archer Daniels Midland Company's (ADM) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A', with a Negative Outlook. This reflects ADM's strong business profile but also acknowledges elevated readily marketable inventories (RMI)-adjusted EBITDA leverage of 1.8x projected for 2025, due to softer EBITDA in a challenging market.
