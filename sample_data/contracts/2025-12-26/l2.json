Traditional growth sectors like Technology are consolidating in neutral territory while cyclicals (Industrials, Consumer Cyclical) show momentum deterioration. This rotation pattern suggests investors are positioning for potential economic slowdown while maintaining exposure to AI infrastructure themes through defensive sectors. The 6 bullish vs 4 bearish sector split with moderate velocity indicates a measured rotation rather than panic-driven moves.",
  "l1_alignment": "L1's NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias aligns well with selective sector rotation. The defensive outperformance doesn't contradict risk-on positioning as it's driven by AI infrastructure themes and rate sensitivity rather than fear. Quality defensive sectors with growth catalysts (XLRE data centers, XLU power demand) support aggressive positioning within a stable macro framework.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: CONTRACTION (MEDIUM confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias aligns with sector rotation showing defensive leadership (Real Estate, Utilities igniting) while growth sectors (Tech, Industrials) consolidate. VIX at extreme lows supports selective risk-taking in quality names.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll signals validated against v6.1 thresholds. IGNITION signals (XLRE, XLU) show positive MRS_5 from negative MRS_20 zones. TREND signals (XLB, XLC, XLV, XLF) maintain positive momentum in positive zones. WEAKENING signals (XLI, XLY) show negative MRS_5 despite positive MRS_20.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: D (4 sectors - XLRE, XLU igniting; XLP, XLE avoiding), A (4 sectors trending), B (2 sectors weakening), E (1 sector neutral). Rotation direction shows defensive sectors gaining momentum while cyclicals weaken.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo major L1 vs L2 conflict. NORMAL regime supports selective positioning, which aligns with mixed sector performance. Defensive outperformance justified by holiday season positioning and January volatility concerns despite overall risk-on environment.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nCONTRACTION phase identified by defensive sector leadership (Utilities, Real Estate) outperforming cyclicals (Industrials, Consumer Cyclical weakening). Traditional late-cycle pattern with rate-sensitive sectors benefiting from Fed cuts while growth sectors consolidate. Energy weakness and Consumer Defensive underperformance typical of economic transition periods.\n\nKey Insight: The market is experiencing a unique \"defensive growth\" rotation where traditional defensive sectors (Real Estate, Utilities) are leading due to AI infrastructure demand, creating opportunities for aggressive positioning in historically defensive sectors while cyclicals face pressure from economic uncertainty."
