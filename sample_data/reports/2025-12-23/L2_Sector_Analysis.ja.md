## セクター分析

### エグゼクティブサマリー
サイクル段階: EARLY_EXPANSION（低い確信度）。ローテーションバイアス: NEUTRAL。主要な洞察: L1のAGGRESSIVEな姿勢にもかかわらず、セクターローテーションは11セクター中8セクターがモメンタムの悪化を示しており、市場は2026年のための持続可能なリーダーシップパターンを確立するのではなく、休暇条件下でコンソリデーションしていることを示唆している。

### マーケットナラティブ
- エネルギー、公共事業、不動産の弱さ: ウランセクターの楽観視、役員任命、エネルギー貯蔵の課題、公共事業の規制問題、インフラファンド；ウランセクターの動向、エネルギー貯蔵技術、公共事業の規制変更、インフラ投資、アナリストの格下げ。

### ローテーションサマリー
ローテーションは明確なリーダーシップが出ていない混合パターンを示しています。テクノロジーはAIテーマによって支えられた控えめな相対的強さを維持していますが、伝統的に強いセクター（金融、素材、工業）はポジショニングがプラスにもかかわらずモメンタムの悪化を示しています。防衛的セクターは全般的に弱く、特に消費者必需品セクターが最も悪いパフォーマンスを示しています。モメンタム（F）またはトレンド（A）ゾーンの欠如は、市場が新しいリーダーシップパターンを確立するのではなく、コンソリデーションしていることを示唆しています。
