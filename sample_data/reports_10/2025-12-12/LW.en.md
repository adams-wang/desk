**5. Lamb Weston: Stability Returns, But Performance Is Far From Impressive (NYSE:LW)**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251215T134226 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Lamb Weston (LW) has seen its share price stabilize after a significant decline, but its 2026 outlook projects flat sales and decreasing EBITDA, suggesting unimpressive performance. Despite efforts from activist investors and cost reductions, the company's earnings power remains around $3 per share with no immediate expectation of margin improvement. High net debt and elevated leverage limit financial flexibility, even with modest cash flow gains and reduced capital spending, making a significant rebound contingent on renewed margin growth.
