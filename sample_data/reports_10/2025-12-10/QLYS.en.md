### Key Risks

1. Insider selling cluster: $3.4M in recent transactions.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Elevated short interest (13.3%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.10 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 20.6x stretched relative to 6% growth. Quality metrics strong (ROE 39%, ROA 14%, margin 29%). Insider selling cluster ($3.4M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 5 selling).

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
