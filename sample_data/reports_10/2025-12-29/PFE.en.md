- Pfizer Inc. (PFE) stock is holding steady in the mid-$20s as 2025 concludes, with investors considering the conflicting realities of near-term revenue pressures from fading COVID-era sales and patent expirations against the potential for long-term growth from its oncology pipeline and new categories like obesity. The company's 2026 guidance, which includes lower-than-expected EPS, and its strong dividend yield, are central to investor sentiment while the market awaits clearer growth visibility. Significant pipeline milestones, particularly in oncology, are seen as key to replacing declining legacy revenues.

Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
