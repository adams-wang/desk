- UPS is strategically shifting towards higher-margin healthcare and small-to-medium-sized business deliveries, reducing its reliance on lower-margin Amazon deliveries.

- This article compares United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) as long-term investment options, despite FedEx's recent stock outperformance. The author argues that UPS, guided by CEO Carol Tomé, is making strategic shifts towards higher-margin deliveries in healthcare and small-to-medium businesses while reducing reliance on Amazon, which should improve profitability and productivity.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
