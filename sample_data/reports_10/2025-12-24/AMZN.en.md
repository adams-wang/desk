- Amazon (AMZN) faces a pivotal moment heading into 2026, with investors closely watching its potential investment in OpenAI, growing AWS AI spending, and expansion into ultra-fast delivery options.

- The Direxion Daily AMZN Bull 2X Shares (AMZU) ETF offers 200% daily leveraged exposure to Amazon, but it is unsuitable for long-term investors due to significant volatility decay. Despite Amazon's strong fundamentals, AMZU has severely underperformed, highlighting the destructive nature of daily rebalancing in choppy markets. A diversified leveraged ETF like ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) is suggested as a better alternative for short-term tactical trading.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
