- Astera Labs Inc. experienced a 9.58% stock increase despite TD Cowen cutting its price target from $225 to $170, reflecting mixed investor sentiment. The company’s strong financial metrics, including a 75.4% gross margin and low debt-to-equity ratio, present a resilient picture, although decreased cash flow from investing activities and intraday volatility raise some concerns.
