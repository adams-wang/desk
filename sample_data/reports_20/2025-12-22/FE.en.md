**1. FirstEnergy agrees to $275M settlement to end PUCO investigations into HB 6 violations**
- Source: WKYC | 20251220T000918 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- FirstEnergy has agreed to a $275 million settlement with Ohio, aiming to resolve investigations into their involvement in the House Bill 6 corruption scandal and provide restitution to customers. The agreement, which would see $250 million directed to all customers and an additional $25 million specifically for residential customers (including $20 million for low-income assistance and energy efficiency programs), must be approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. This settlement seeks to put an end to the fallout from the $60 million bribery scheme that led to the conviction of former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder.

**2. Georgia regulators approve huge electric generation increase for data centers**
- Source: AP News | 20251220T050853 | Neutral | Relevance: 58%
- Georgia's Public Service Commission has unanimously approved a plan for Georgia Power Co. to increase its power capacity by 50% to meet the rising demand from data centers, particularly those supporting artificial intelligence. This significant expansion, costing an estimated $16.3 billion to construct and up to $60 billion for customers over decades, is met with both promises of lower rates for residents by 2029 and concerns from opponents about the financial risks and environmental impact. The decision comes despite recent voter backlash against GOP leadership in commission elections and fears that existing ratepayers might subsidize the energy needs of tech behemoths if demand projections do not materialize.

**3. Eversource Energy (ES): Assessing Valuation After a Strong Year and Recent Pullback**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251221T140755 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 54%
- Eversource Energy (ES) has seen significant stock growth this year, outperforming many utilities, despite a recent modest pullback. The company is considered 7.9% undervalued with a narrative fair value of $72.93, driven by strategic divestitures and cash flow enhancements. However, potential regulatory setbacks or delays in asset sales could impact this outlook.
