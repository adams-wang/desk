### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 9.9% to 0.5% (-9.3% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 3.5pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 (-2.8%) diverging from MRS_20 - short-term weakness emerging. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI neutral at 56. Volume at 54% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -SLN (Support test).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
