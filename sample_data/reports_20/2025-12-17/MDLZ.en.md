- Analysts from Stifel Nicolaus and Goldman Sachs recently reiterated cautious ratings on Conagra Brands, citing concerns about declining sales volumes, limited pricing power, and the muted impact of new product launches in a competitive market. Despite these concerns, Conagra affirmed its fiscal 2026 guidance for organic net sales growth, making the company's ability to stabilize volumes central to investor assessment.
