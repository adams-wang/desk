### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +4.5% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 32.13 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 12.7x stretched relative to 2% growth. Balance sheet: $1.2B free cash flow. Insider selling cluster ($3.9M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).
