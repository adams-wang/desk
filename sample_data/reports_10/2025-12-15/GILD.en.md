**1. Gilead’s experimental HIV treatment meets main goal in late-stage trial**
- Source: WTVB | 20251215T230702 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Gilead Sciences announced its experimental HIV treatment met its primary endpoint in a late-stage trial, offering potential new treatment avenues. The once-daily, single-tablet combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir proved as effective as their existing drug, Biktarvy, for patients with suppressed HIV. This development could help improve long-term viral control.

- Gilead Sciences announced positive topline results from its Phase 3 ARTISTRY-2 trial, evaluating an investigational single-tablet regimen of bictegravir and lenacapavir (BIC/LEN) for HIV treatment. The study found BIC/LEN to be statistically non-inferior to BIKTARVY for adults with HIV who are virologically suppressed. Gilead plans to submit these findings to regulatory authorities and for presentation at a future scientific congress.

- Gilead Sciences announced positive topline results from its Phase 3 ARTISTRY-2 trial, demonstrating that its investigational single-tablet regimen of bictegravir and lenacapavir (BIC/LEN) met the primary endpoint for non-inferiority in HIV treatment compared to BIKTARVY. This novel combination, which combines an integrase strand transfer inhibitor with a first-in-class capsid inhibitor, was generally well tolerated and could expand future treatment options for virologically suppressed adults with HIV. The company plans to use these results, alongside those from the ARTISTRY-1 trial, for regulatory submissions.

These results, combined with ARTISTRY-1 findings, will support regulatory submissions for this investigational treatment.

**5. Gilead’s experimental HIV treatment meets main goal in late-stage trial**

- Gilead Sciences announced that its experimental HIV treatment, a once-daily, single-tablet combination of bictegravir and lenacapavir, met its primary goal in a late-stage trial. The company stated this treatment regimen could broaden options and help patients maintain long-term control of the virus. The study showed it was as effective as Gilead's current HIV pill Biktarvy in patients whose virus was already suppressed.
