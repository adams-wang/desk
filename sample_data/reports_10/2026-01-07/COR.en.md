**1. Cencora stock price target lowered to $360 by BofA on valuation concerns**
- Source: Investing.com Canada | 20260106T040834 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- BofA Securities has lowered its price target for Cencora Inc (NYSE:COR) to $360 from $380, citing valuation concerns despite the company's strong long-term outlook. This adjustment comes as Cencora's current trading valuation, including a P/E ratio of 41.52 and a PEG ratio of 7.41, suggests it is trading at a premium relative to its growth rate. While other analysts have raised price targets following Cencora's acquisition of OneOncology and increased growth targets, BofA has slightly reduced free cash flow estimates due to anticipated wholesale acquisition cost price declines.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
