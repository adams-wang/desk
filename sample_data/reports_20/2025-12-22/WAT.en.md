- Revvity, Inc. launched Signals Xynthetica, an AI-powered platform for molecular and materials design, aiming to integrate AI directly into laboratory workflows. This move reinforces Revvity's strategy to shift towards higher-margin, software-enabled tools, offsetting pressures in legacy diagnostics and supporting recurring digital revenue.
