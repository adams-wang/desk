4. Near-term weakness: 6.1% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +18.0% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
