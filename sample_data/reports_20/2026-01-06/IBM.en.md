The company is focusing on Watsonx, Red Hat OpenShift, and updated mainframes and Power servers to enable in-place modernization for regulated and mission-critical workloads.

- IBM (IBM) has experienced a recent pullback, dropping 5% over the past month, but still boasts a strong 34.31% return over the past year. Analysts generally see a slim upside from its current price of $291.5, with a consensus target of $281.316, although some bullish forecasts reach $350. The article questions whether IBM's future growth from hybrid cloud and AI is already factored into its current valuation, noting its P/E ratio is higher than peers, yet Simply Wall St's fair ratio suggests potential for the market to edge higher.

- IBM shares closed down 1.6% at $291.50 on Friday, slipping under the $300 mark, as Wall Street anticipates key U.S. jobs and inflation data, which could influence interest-rate expectations. Investors are also looking ahead to IBM’s fourth-quarter earnings announcement set for January 28, where focus will be on software growth, consulting demand, and free cash flow. The stock's performance is further impacted by broader market trends and the company's strategic moves into hybrid-cloud and AI, tempered by execution risks and competitive pressures.
