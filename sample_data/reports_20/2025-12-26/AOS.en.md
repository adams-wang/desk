- Stifel has maintained a "Hold" rating on Ingersoll Rand Inc. (IR) and increased its price target from $75 to $81, citing tariff-related price hikes and strong pricing power for diversified industrial companies. Meanwhile, Citi reiterated its "Buy" rating and boosted its price objective for IR from $91 to $94, expecting industry development in 2026 driven by artificial intelligence, despite revised EBITDA guidance due to tariff impacts and backlog growth delays. Ingersoll Rand operates in industrial technologies and precision and science technologies, and both firms anticipate continued growth for the company, though some AI stocks are seen as having greater upside potential.
