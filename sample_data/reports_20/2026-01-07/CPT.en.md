- Camden Property Trust (CPT) has seen mixed short-term share performance but steady long-term gains, prompting a reevaluation of its US$110.31 price. While the company appears modestly undervalued at US$115.93 based on a narrative fair value, its high P/E ratio of 43.7x compared to peers suggests the market may be pricing in future growth aggressively.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
