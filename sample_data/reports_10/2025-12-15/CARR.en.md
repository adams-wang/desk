**1. Carrier Global Shares Face Headwinds Amid Divergent Forces**

- Carrier Global Corp is caught between significant capital deployment for shareholder returns and a slowdown in its core U.S. residential business. While institutional investors are increasing their stakes and the company has ambitious long-term targets, immediate concerns arise from a weaker Q4 2025 forecast and subsequent analyst downgrades. A $5.0 billion share repurchase program and quarterly dividend aim to stabilize investor confidence, but the stock's short-term vulnerability depends on a recovery in residential demand and execution of growth strategies.
