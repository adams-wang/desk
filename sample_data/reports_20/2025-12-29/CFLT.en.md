### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 12.0% to 6.0% (-5.9% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Currently in lower STRENGTH zone (4.0-10.0%), cross-sectional ranking at 97th percentile. MRS_5 at 0.3% confirms short-term momentum alignment. AM_20 at 6.5% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 5.8pp, stock-specific strength. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI overbought at 77, risk of mean reversion. Volume at 14% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +SUL (Resistance test).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
