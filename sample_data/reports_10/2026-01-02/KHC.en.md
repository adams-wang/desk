- Kraft Heinz (KHC) stock remained flat despite completing the sale of its Italian baby and specialty food business Plasmon to NewPrinces for $146 million. This divestment is part of Kraft Heinz's strategy to streamline its business and focus on "Accelerate platforms" like Tomato Ketchup and other "Taste Elevation" products. The company also announced plans to split into two independent entities, Global Taste Elevation and North American Grocery, by late 2026, and its stock has experienced a challenging year, sliding around 16%.

- Kraft Heinz, once dominant in the mac and cheese market, has seen its share decline from 45% in 2022 to 39% as premium competitor Goodles gains ground. Goodles, launched in 2021, offers a more nutritious alternative, appealing to consumers seeking healthier options in comfort food. This shift, along with pressure from private-label brands, has prompted Kraft Heinz to announce a plan to split into two publicly traded companies.

Steve Cahillane will take over as CEO on January 1, 2026, with the primary task of splitting Kraft Heinz into two independent companies: "Global Taste Elevation Co." and "North American Grocery Co." This transition occurs as the company grapples with a recent stake reduction by Berkshire Hathaway and a cautious outlook from market analysts, despite a steady dividend yield for investors.

Princes Italia will manage Plasmon's operations under an asset lease agreement, allowing the Group operational flexibility and preserving capital for future growth.
