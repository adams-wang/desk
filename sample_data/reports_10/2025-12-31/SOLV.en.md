- Solventum, a 3M spinoff, overcame initial investor unrest in 2025 by selling its purification and filtration business for $4 billion and acquiring Acera Surgical for $850 million. These strategic moves allowed the company to pay down debt, streamline its portfolio, and attract renewed investor confidence, leading to a significant turnaround in its financial performance and stock price. CEO Bryan Hanson's focus on efficiency and a decentralized structure has positioned the company for positive momentum in 2026.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
