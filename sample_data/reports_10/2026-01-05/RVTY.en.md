- Source: inkl | 20260105T100903 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Revvity, Inc. (RVTY) is set to announce its Q4 2025 earnings, with analysts expecting an adjusted EPS of $1.54, an 8.5% increase from the previous year. Despite a robust earnings surprise history, the stock has underperformed the broader market, falling 12.4% over the past year due to weak constant-currency revenue growth and declining operating margins. Analysts maintain a "Moderate Buy" rating with a 16% upside potential, but caution remains due to a full valuation.
