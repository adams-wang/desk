By identifying property components eligible for shorter depreciation periods, such as those covered by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), owners can realize substantial immediate tax savings. This strategy allows the reinvestment of tax savings back into properties or other projects, maximizing current deductions and helping owners unlock hidden value in their CRE portfolios.
