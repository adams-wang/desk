### Key Risks

1. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-8.5% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
2. Insider selling cluster: $4.3M in recent transactions.
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.3x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Elevated short interest (9.1%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.27 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (margin 16%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (5.4x), low leverage (D/E 0.13). Analyst sentiment positive (2 raises, avg +33%). Insider selling cluster ($4.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (4 buying vs 6 selling).

Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). Volume at 36% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +STL (Rally).
