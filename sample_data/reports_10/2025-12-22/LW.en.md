**1. Why Lamb Weston (LW) Shares Are Sliding Today**
- Source: Finviz | 20251222T210843 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Shares of Lamb Weston (LW) fell by 2.1% after BNP Paribas Exane downgraded the stock to 'Neutral' and significantly lowered its price target, citing intensifying competition. This follows a similar action by Bank of America Securities and was exacerbated by the company's recent Q2 earnings report, which, despite beating Wall Street expectations, included full-year guidance projecting flat revenue and an 11% fall in a key earnings metric, indicating a potential sacrifice of profitability for market share. These concerns, coupled with a previous 24.1% drop due to a disappointing full-year outlook, have led to a 35.1% year-to-date decline for the stock.
