- D-Wave Quantum shares stabilized on Monday after a significant three-session slide, reigniting debates about valuing early-stage quantum-computing companies. Despite new analyst coverage offering price targets ranging from $35 to $46, a wide gap remains between bullish long-term forecasts and immediate valuation concerns, with some analysts flagging deeper downside potential for the stock.

Wall Street analysts remain largely positive on the stock, issuing "Strong Buy" ratings and high price targets, while some valuation warnings suggest potential deeper downside as the company prepares for upcoming events like CES Foundry and Qubits 2026. The quantum computing pure-play faces a "tug-of-war" between high-risk, high-upside potential and continued valuation concerns ahead of Monday's market open.

- D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) stock experienced an 8% slide on Friday, closing the week at $25.29, prompting investors to consider its high volatility and the diverse analyst opinions. Despite a substantial cash reserve of $836.2 million and increasing revenue, concerns persist about dilution from equity activities and the wide range of price targets from bullish to more cautious outlooks. Investors are now looking ahead to upcoming catalysts like CES 2026, the Qubits 2026 user conference, and the formation of a new U.S. government-focused business unit for D-Wave.
