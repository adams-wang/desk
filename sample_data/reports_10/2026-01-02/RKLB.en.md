- Rocket Lab USA, Inc. reported record-breaking annual revenue approaching $600 million for fiscal year 2025, driven by a 100% success rate across 21 Electron missions and robust Space Systems growth. However, the maiden flight of its Neutron medium-lift rocket has been delayed to mid-2026 due to extended qualification for its Archimedes engine. Despite short-term market volatility, a $1.1 billion contract backlog and a strategic pivot towards high-margin satellite manufacturing provide a strong financial foundation and long-term optimism for the company.
