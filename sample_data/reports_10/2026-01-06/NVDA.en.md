- Siemens and NVIDIA are expanding their partnership to create an "Industrial AI operating system," aiming to revolutionize the entire industrial value chain from design to manufacturing and supply chains. This collaboration will focus on AI-native electronic design, simulation, and adaptive manufacturing, with the goal of developing next-generation AI factories and optimizing operations through shared innovation. The initiative will involve NVIDIA providing AI infrastructure and Siemens contributing industrial AI experts and hardware/software, starting with an AI-driven manufacturing site in Erlangen, Germany, by 2026.

**2. Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Raymond James Stays Bullish with a “Strong Buy” Rating**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20260106T140923 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Raymond James has reiterated its "Strong Buy" rating for Nvidia (NVDA) with a 12-month target of $272.00 per share, following CEO Jensen Huang's CES keynote which reinforced confidence in the company’s market leadership in AI. Analysts noted strong demand, robust December sales, and solid long-term supply chain planning, with Nvidia confirming production of its next-generation Vera Rubin platform. Both technical and fundamental indicators support a highly constructive outlook, with a consensus "Strong Buy" rating and an implied 35% upside reflecting confidence in Nvidia's growth potential.

**3. NVIDIA Reveals Why the Company Is “Immune” to Memory Shortages — and How The Firm Prepaid Inventory to Keep the AI Boom Running**
- Source: Wccftech | 20260106T140823 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- NVIDIA claims to be "immune" to the current memory shortages affecting the industry, attributing this to early and massive investments in partners, including prepayments, to expand capacity. The company's direct purchasing of DRAM at a global scale and its ability to transform it into CoWoS supercomputers provide a significant advantage in managing its supply chain. While NVIDIA's AI division benefits from these strategies, its consumer gaming business, however, is feeling the pinch, experiencing product launch delays and necessitating the reintroduction of older GPU models.

**4. NVIDIA releases new physical AI models, plus autonomous vehicle tools**
- Source: The Robot Report | 20260106T130832 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- NVIDIA has introduced new open models, frameworks, simulation tools, datasets, and AI infrastructure designed for robotics and self-driving vehicle developers. These advancements aim to enable "physical AI" — models that can understand, reason, and plan actions in dynamic real-world environments. The company emphasizes the shift towards "generalist-specialist" robots and unveiled the Jetson T4000 module and Alpamayo models to power next-generation autonomous machines and vehicles.

**5. Nvidia: Full Steam Ahead With an Impressive Array of Announcements at CES 2026**
- Source: Morningstar | 20260106T100902 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Nvidia showcased its latest product innovations at CES 2026, including the Vera Rubin products set for release in the second half of 2026 which are expected to deliver five times the performance of current Blackwell products for certain AI inference tasks. The company also announced a full-stack autonomous driving solution to be integrated into the Mercedes-Benz CLA in Q1 2026, further solidifying its position in the physical AI market. Morningstar maintains its $240 fair value estimate for Nvidia, believing the stock to be undervalued despite recent AI bubble concerns.
