**1. ASH: J&J makes case for Tecvayli combo as an alternative to CAR-T in 2nd-line multiple myeloma**
- Source: Fierce Pharma | 20251209T120837 | Bullish | Relevance: 99%
-  Johnson & Johnson presented positive Phase 3 MajesTEC-3 trial data for its Tecvayli-Darzalex combination in multiple myeloma patients, showing an 83% reduction in progression or death risk. This regimen, which significantly improved overall survival, could be a strong alternative to CAR T-cell therapies like J&J’s own Carvykti, especially for patients who cannot access CAR-T in community settings. The data suggests potential competition for existing CAR-T treatments and highlights J&J's efforts to expand Tecvayli's role in earlier lines of therapy.

**3. Health changes everything: Europe’s smart investment**
- Source: Economist Impact | 20251209T090851 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- Europe faces demographic challenges including an aging population and rising chronic disease, which threaten economic growth. The article argues that treating healthcare as an investment rather than a cost can drive productivity, competitiveness, and prosperity, citing economic benefits that far outweigh the initial investment. It highlights how past austerity measures weakened health systems and calls for political decision-makers to prioritize long-term health outcomes and innovation.

**4. J&J’s $1.7 billion bet on Israeli heart device falters after FDA panel vote**
- Source: CTech | 20251210T084136 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of Israeli heart-device maker V-Wave, valued at up to $1.7 billion, is in jeopardy after an FDA advisory panel unanimously voted against the effectiveness and risk-benefit of V-Wave's Ventura Interatrial Shunt System. The acquisition's full value, with $1.1 billion contingent on regulatory approval, is now uncertain as the FDA typically follows such recommendations, potentially limiting the device's market or requiring further trials. This outcome impacts J&J's strategy to offset future revenue loss from other blockbuster drugs.

**5. J&J’s ‘remarkable’ Tecvayli data support earlier use in multiple myeloma**
- Source: BioPharma Dive | 20251209T130817 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
-  New data from Johnson & Johnson's MajesTEC-3 trial suggest that a Tecvayli-based combination therapy could offer a curative potential when used early in the treatment of multiple myeloma. The combination of Tecvayli with Darzalex significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 83% and led to an 82% complete response rate, compared to standard treatments. This positive outcome points to a future where bispecific antibodies like Tecvayli could be moved to earlier lines of care, offering a more accessible alternative to CAR-T therapies, though vigilance regarding infection risks remains crucial.
