**1. Woodside and BOTAS finalise long-term LNG supply agreement**
- Source: euro-petrole.com | 20251229T100929 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 61%
- Woodside and Turkey's BOTAŞ have signed a long-term Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) for the supply of approximately 0.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG over nine years, starting in 2030. This agreement converts a previous non-binding Heads of Agreement into a binding commitment and strengthens cooperation in the LNG value chain, primarily sourcing LNG from the Louisiana LNG project in the United States and Woodside's broader portfolio. The deal highlights Woodside's diversified portfolio and reinforces Turkish-US energy relations, promoting energy security and economic growth for both nations.

**2. Documents Show Houston Oil Giant SLB Aiding Russian Oil Production Despite US Sanctions**
- Source: Kyiv Post | 20251229T103004 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 60%
- Documents obtained by analytics firm Dallas indicate that Houston-based energy giant SLB (formerly Schlumberger) continued transferring proprietary drilling technology to Russian manufacturers as recently as February 2025, weeks after new US sanctions targeting Russia's oil sector took effect. This activity, including detailed engineering drawings for critical oil extraction equipment components, raises concerns that SLB is undermining US sanctions and supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine. Despite having promised to exit the Russian market years earlier, SLB's continued presence and deepening involvement suggest a long-term strategy rather than a withdrawal.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
