- Source: Barchart.com | 20251229T164034 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- This article proposes an options strategy to gain leveraged upside in Costco stock (COST) at a lower cost than directly buying shares. It involves buying long-dated in-the-money (ITM) call options and simultaneously selling short-dated out-of-the-money (OTM) put and call options to offset the initial cost and generate additional income. While offering a potentially higher return, the strategy carries risks such as potential unrealized losses if the stock price drops below the put strike or if OTM calls need to be bought back at a loss.

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
