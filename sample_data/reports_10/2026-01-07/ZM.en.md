### Key Risks

1. Heavy insider selling: $25M sold (17 transactions in 90 days).
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.7x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.75 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (margin 33%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (4.4x), low leverage (D/E 0.23). Analyst sentiment positive (1 raises, avg +7%, $97 target (+12%)). Insider selling cluster ($25.4M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 3 selling).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
