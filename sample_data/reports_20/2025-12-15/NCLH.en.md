- Source: ts2.tech | 20251213T140839 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) stock is trading at a significant discount despite the company achieving record revenue and profits in Q3 2025.

The company's strategic shift toward family-focused, shorter Caribbean cruises could dilute pricing, leading to a high-reward, high-risk scenario for investors.
