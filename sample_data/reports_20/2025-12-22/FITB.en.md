**1. Fifth Third-Comerica deal may signal opportunity for local banks**
- Source: Crain's Detroit Business | 20251222T110749 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
- The acquisition of Comerica Bank by Fifth Third Bank for $10.9 billion, a "rare mega deal," is expected to pave the way for more mergers and acquisitions in the banking sector in 2026, especially as regulatory environments become more favorable. This consolidation could present opportunities for local community banks to expand by acquiring newly available branch locations and talent, though it also carries risks of customer anxiety and potential shifts to other financial institutions. Experts note that despite these large-scale deals, most customers tend to remain with their banks due to the inconvenience of switching accounts.

**2. HoldCo urges Comerica shareholders to vote against Fifth Third merger**

- HoldCo Asset Management, holding roughly $2.6 billion in assets, is advising Comerica Inc. (NYSE:CMA) shareholders to reject the proposed merger with Fifth Third Bancorp. The firm claims the merger was rushed to prevent a potential proxy contest and that Comerica's board dismissed alternative proposals. HoldCo suggests Comerica's fair value in a sale could be significantly higher—around $120 per share—and that rejecting the current merger would lead to a renegotiation for improved terms.

- HoldCo Asset Management has released a presentation to Comerica Inc.'s Board of Directors, urging shareholders to vote "NO" on a proposed merger. HoldCo believes newly disclosed information reveals that the merger process was rushed, driven by a desire to neutralize a proxy contest and secure a favorable compensation package for the CEO, rather than to maximize shareholder value. They argue that a "NO" vote has limited downside and could lead to a substantially higher valuation for shareholders.
