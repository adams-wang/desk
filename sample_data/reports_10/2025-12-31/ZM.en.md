2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.8x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.83 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (margin 33%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (4.4x), low leverage (D/E 0.23). Insider selling cluster ($25.6M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 3 selling).

|-------|--------|----------|

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
