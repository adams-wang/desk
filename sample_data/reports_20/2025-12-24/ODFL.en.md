### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 8.6% to 3.4% (-5.3% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 0.6pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis).

Volume at 44% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +SUL (Resistance test).

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | WEAKENING (Zone B) | 0.75x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
