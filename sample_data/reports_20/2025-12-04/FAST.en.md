- Fastenal (FAST) recently reported a 6% increase in November net sales and a 12% rise in daily sales, sparking investor interest in its valuation. The stock, currently around $41.22, has seen its price cool off while still showing strong long-term momentum. Despite a "modestly positive" narrative fair value of $43.46, its P/E ratio of 38.6 times suggests it may be pricey compared to the industry average, raising concerns about multiple compression if growth falters.
