### Key Risks

1. High beta (4.24) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (16.0%, 1.3 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
4. Near-term weakness: 13.1% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +10.1% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
