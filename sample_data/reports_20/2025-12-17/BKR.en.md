**3. Is SLB Offering Long Term Value After Its Digital and Low Carbon Expansion?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251216T012717 | Neutral | Relevance: 65%
- SLB appears to be undervalued based on its digital and low-carbon technology expansion, as indicated by both Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Price-to-Earnings (PE) analyses. The DCF model suggests a 57.0% discount compared to its intrinsic value, while its current PE ratio of 15.9x is below its proprietary "Fair Ratio" of 20.3x, implying potential undervaluation. Investors are encouraged to explore different perspectives on SLB's future using "Narratives" on Simply Wall St's community page.

Conversely, the firm downgraded Archer-Daniels-Midland to Underweight, lowering its price target to $50 due to stretched expectations for 2026 earnings and weakness in its Carbohydrate Solutions segment. The bank highlighted that market focus is shifting from broad agricultural trends to individual company execution, favoring Bunge's strategic moves and stronger earnings outlook.
