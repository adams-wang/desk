- Amcor plc (AMCR) is implementing a 1-for-5 reverse stock split, effective January 14, 2026, which will consolidate its outstanding shares and adjust its capital structure. While this move simplifies Amcor's finances and raises its per-share reference price, it does not alter the core investment thesis around integrating Berry Global and divesting weaker businesses. Investors are expected to focus on whether cost synergies and asset restructurings can offset soft volumes and high leverage to improve returns, especially given that the dividend is not fully covered by earnings.

- International Paper is undergoing a major corporate transformation involving facility closures, a significant acquisition, and portfolio optimization to focus on its core packaging operations. Investors are keenly watching the upcoming financial release on January 29, 2026, for indications that these strategic actions, including the sale of its cellulose fibers business and the DS Smith acquisition, will lead to lasting margin improvement and stabilize North American containerboard shipments. The success of this strategy hinges on effective cost reductions and seamless volume relocation without disruption, which would validate the investment thesis despite elevated debt levels.
