### Key Risks

1. Heavy insider selling: $25M sold (17 transactions in 90 days).
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 4.7x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

Analyst sentiment positive (1 raises, avg +7%, $97 target (+13%)). Insider selling cluster ($25.4M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 3 selling).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | RISK_ON (MEDIUM) | 1.10x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*RISK_ON regime with strong participation and low volatility. VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) with breadth at 63.5% signals healthy risk appetite. Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
