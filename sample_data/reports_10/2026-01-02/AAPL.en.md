- Apple shares declined after Raymond James initiated coverage with a "market perform" rating, citing valuation concerns and a lack of immediate catalysts. This comes amid a Financial Times report indicating Apple has significantly scaled back production and marketing for its Vision Pro headset due to weak demand and disappointing sales figures. Investors are now looking to Apple's next earnings report for updates on iPhone demand, services growth, and AI feature rollout.

- Source: ts2.tech | 20260102T150708 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Apple shares rose slightly at the open of 2026, trading at $273.08, after Raymond James initiated coverage with a neutral "market perform" rating, citing valuation concerns and limited immediate catalysts. Investors are closely watching upcoming U.S. jobs and inflation data, as well as Apple's own earnings report on January 29, to gauge the Federal Reserve's rate path and the company's future growth prospects. The stock's premium valuation leaves it vulnerable to shifts in economic expectations despite early interest from investors.

**3. Apple's (AAPL) Market Perform Rating Reaffirmed at Raymond James Financial**
- Source: MarketBeat | 20260102T131122 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Raymond James Financial has reaffirmed its "Market Perform" rating for Apple (AAPL), citing limited upside based on current valuations despite the company beating quarterly estimates. While analyst consensus leans towards a "Moderate Buy" with an average target price of $283.92, concerns include insider selling and weaker-than-expected demand for the Vision Pro, which is seen as a significant drag on sentiment. Heavy institutional ownership continues, with Apple's market capitalization at $4.02 trillion.

**4. Raymond James downgrades Apple, says gains will be hard to come by in 2026**
- Source: CNBC | 20260102T120842 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Raymond James has downgraded Apple to a market perform rating, citing the company's high valuation and limited near-term upside. Analyst Melissa Fairbanks believes that Apple's current stock price already reflects its strengths, making significant further outperformance difficult. Despite strong fundamentals and anticipated growth from its Services business and AI integration, the firm suggests that Apple's large existing user base will make incremental gains from technology upgrade cycles harder to achieve.

- Source: FinancialContent | 20260102T100600 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Raymond James has resumed coverage of Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a neutral "Market Perform" rating, citing that its current valuation already incorporates optimism around its AI roadmap. Despite Apple's strong ecosystem and impressive market capitalization, the firm expressed caution regarding its high P/E ratio, the challenges of continued user growth, and tepid interest in the Vision Pro. The report highlights a shift towards a more mature, valuation-sensitive era for Apple, amidst regulatory pressures and a turbulent global economy.
