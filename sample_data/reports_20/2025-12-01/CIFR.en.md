2. Heavy insider selling: $145M sold (29 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 9.9x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. High short interest (21.4%, 1.2 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_20 improving +14.4% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

Analyst sentiment positive (1 raises, avg +50%). Insider selling cluster ($145.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).
