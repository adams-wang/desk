**1. Acadia Healthcare Updates PLGL Reserves Following Annual Actuarial Review, Lowers 2025 Guidance**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251202T160500 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. announced an update to its professional and general liability (PLGL) reserves after its annual actuarial review, leading to a reduction in its full-year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share guidance. The revised projections are primarily due to higher expected settlement costs for patient-related litigation, a significant increase in claim frequency, and less favorable reinsurance terms. The company anticipates a substantial increase in its net PLGL liability by the end of 2025 and provided initial guidance for 2026 PLGL expenses.
