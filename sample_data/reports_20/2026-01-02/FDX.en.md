**1. How Should Investors Approach FDX Stock in the New Year?**
- Source: www.sharewise.com | 20260102T184453 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Despite declining package volumes, FedEx (FDX) shares outperformed the Zacks Transportation—Air Freight and Cargo industry in 2025, driven by cost-cutting initiatives. While the company's Q2 fiscal 2026 results exceeded expectations and guidance was raised, FedEx is not considered an opportune buy due to ongoing challenges like tariffs and the upcoming spin-off of its freight unit with limited immediate impact or financial visibility. Investors are advised to track developments for a better entry point or remain invested if they already hold the stock.

- Despite a decline in package volumes, FedEx's shares outperformed its industry and rival UPS in 2025 due to aggressive cost-cutting measures. The company recently reported better-than-expected Q2 fiscal 2026 results and raised its full-year guidance, driven by the DRIVE program and strong Federal Express segment performance. While the upcoming spin-off of its Freight unit and shareholder-friendly initiatives are positive, Zacks currently advises a "Hold" rating due to immediate challenges and limited visibility into the new entity's financials.

- DHL Supply Chain's Tesla Semi pilot program "exceeded expectations," demonstrating the electric truck's capacity to efficiently haul freight over long distances on a single charge. This success paves the way for DHL to expand its North American electric vehicle fleet, contributing to its goal of having 30% of its heavy-duty trucking fleet be battery-electric or zero-emissions by 2030, and net-zero logistics by 2050. Tesla expects serial production of the Semi to begin in late 2025, with increased capacity in 2026.
