### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -6.2% to -2.8% (+3.4% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 6.8pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (0.6%) - potential reversal signal. AM_20 at -3.4% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 4.0pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.07x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). MACD histogram positive (0.64), confirming momentum. Volume at 37% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +DUL (Resistance).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
