- In 2025, the artificial intelligence investment landscape shifted dramatically, with "boring" companies providing data center infrastructure outperforming traditional tech giants. Data storage companies like Sandisk Corp., Western Digital Corp., and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc took the top spots on the S&P 500, while AI chipmaker Nvidia saw more modest gains. This trend highlights a broader investor pivot towards the "picks and shovels" supporting the AI boom, including power, cooling, wiring, and construction providers for data centers, and even Bitcoin miners retooling for high-performance computing.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
