**1. Air Products Stock Plunges to 52‑Week Low on Yara Hydrogen Deal – What It Means for APD Investors Now**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251208T190800 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
-  Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE: APD) stock fell by 9-10% to a 52-week low of $235-236 after announcing advanced partnership talks with Yara International for massive low-emission ammonia projects in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. The market reacted negatively due to concerns over capital intensity, long project timelines, and complex deal structures, despite the potential for long-term demand for low-carbon hydrogen. Despite the sell-off, analysts largely maintain a "Moderate Buy" rating with a 20-30% upside forecast, contingent on successful execution of these capital-intensive projects and the company's cost-cut program.

-  Air Products and Yara are in advanced negotiations to partner on low-emission ammonia projects in Louisiana and Saudi Arabia. The partnership aims to combine Air Products' low-emission hydrogen production with Yara's global ammonia network, targeting final investment decisions by mid-2026 for the Louisiana project and a marketing agreement for the NEOM project in Saudi Arabia by H1 2026. These projects, estimated around $8-9 billion, will produce millions of tons of low-carbon and renewable ammonia annually, leveraging both companies' strengths in the low-emission energy market.
