**Positioning Guidance**
- Regime: NORMAL (IMPROVING)
- Confidence: MEDIUM
- Position size: 95% max
- Key action: Maintain selective exposure, favor quality names benefiting from dovish Fed pivot while avoiding rate-sensitive cyclicals

**Triggers**

- Downgrade: Jobs data deterioration accelerating beyond ADP weakness, VIX spike above 20 on Fed policy uncertainty, Breadth collapse below 40% indicating broad selling

**Risk Factors**
- Banking sector stress from rate sensitivity
- Narrow market breadth suggesting fragile conditions
- Labor market softening beyond Fed comfort zone
- 42 days until next FOMC creates policy uncertainty
