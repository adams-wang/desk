### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.41) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Heavy insider selling: $13M sold (25 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation risk: PEG 5.2x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
4. High short interest (36.6%, 2.6 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
5. Long-term trend broken: trading 21.8% below SMA200.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 5.23 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (ROE 26%). Insider selling cluster ($13.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (10 buying vs 0 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 weakening modestly (-0.6% over 5 days). Below STRENGTH zone by 10.6pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -5.0% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 6.4pp, stock-specific weakness. Below SMA200 (0.78x), long-term trend not supportive. MACD histogram positive (0.57), confirming momentum. Volume at 43% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
