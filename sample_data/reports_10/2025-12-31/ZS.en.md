**3. Can Unified SASE Adoption Strengthen FTNT's Growth Trajectory in 2026?**
- Source: The Globe and Mail | 20251230T180946 | Neutral | Relevance: 88%
- Fortinet (FTNT) is focusing on Unified SASE to drive growth, leveraging its FortiOS platform for integrated networking and security capabilities. Despite competitive pressures from Cisco and Zscaler, Fortinet's flexible deployment options and strong installed base position it for continued SASE adoption. The company's financial outlook for 2026 includes projected revenue growth, though its shares have underperformed and it appears overvalued based on its price-to-book ratio.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
