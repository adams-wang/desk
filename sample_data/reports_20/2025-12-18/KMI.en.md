- Source: ts2.tech | 20251217T103134 | Neutral | Relevance: 64%
- Phillips 66 (PSX) stock experienced a sharp decline on December 17, 2025, closing down 6.9% at $131.78, driven by signs of U.S. economic cooling, falling oil prices, and sector-wide weakness.

Wall Street analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus with an average 12-month target of $144.68, but a Trefis note suggests potential downside of 20-30% in a broader downturn.
