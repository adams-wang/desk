### Key Risks

1. High beta (1.98) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.

3. Near-term weakness: 10.7% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 3 raises (avg +9%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 4.96 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 119.4x stretched relative to 4% growth. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (2.7x), low leverage (D/E 0.27). Analyst sentiment positive (3 raises, avg +9%). Insider selling cluster ($2.2M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (8 buying vs 2 selling).

### Technicals

MRS_20 stable at -6.0% (minimal 5-day change). Below STRENGTH zone by 10.0pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -6.1% indicates price below own 20MA trend.

Volume at 56% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -MTL (Decline).
