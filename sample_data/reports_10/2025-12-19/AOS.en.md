**1. Zurn Elkay Water Solutions (ZWS): Valuation Check After Upbeat Q3 Earnings and Fresh Analyst Buy Ratings**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T110852 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- Analysts have responded positively to Zurn Elkay Water Solutions (ZWS) after strong Q3 earnings and raised guidance, leading to fresh Buy ratings for the stock. Despite a significant share price increase of 27.8% year-to-date and 134.1% over three years, Simply Wall St suggests the company is currently undervalued by 8% with a fair value of $51.25. However, while the narrative supports higher earnings and margin expansion, an earnings-based valuation indicates the stock trades at 42.2 times earnings, higher than the industry average, which could pose a risk if growth slows.
