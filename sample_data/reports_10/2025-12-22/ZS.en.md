**1. Don't Ignore The Insider Selling In Zscaler**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251220T130912 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- A substantial insider sale has occurred at Zscaler, with the Chief Legal Officer & Secretary selling US$1.3m worth of stock. This follows other significant insider sales over the last year, suggesting insiders might view lower prices as fair, despite the company's high insider ownership of 35%. While the selling is a weak signal, it warrants caution.
