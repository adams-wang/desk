### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.07) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 7.1x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. High short interest (21.9%, 10.2 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

PEG ratio 7.09 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Balance sheet: strong liquidity (6.0x), low leverage (D/E 0.36). Revenue growth strong at 22% YoY. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 2 selling).

*RISK_ON regime with strong participation and low volatility. VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) with breadth at 63.5% signals healthy risk appetite. Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
