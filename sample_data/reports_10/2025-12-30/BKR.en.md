**1. Woodside and BOTAS finalise long-term LNG supply agreement**
- Source: euro-petrole.com | 20251229T100929 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 63%
- Woodside and Turkey's BOTAŞ have signed a long-term Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) for the supply of approximately 0.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG over nine years, starting in 2030. This agreement converts a previous non-binding Heads of Agreement into a binding commitment and strengthens cooperation in the LNG value chain, primarily sourcing LNG from the Louisiana LNG project in the United States and Woodside's broader portfolio. The deal highlights Woodside's diversified portfolio and reinforces Turkish-US energy relations, promoting energy security and economic growth for both nations.

**2. Documents Show Houston Oil Giant SLB Aiding Russian Oil Production Despite US Sanctions**
- Source: Kyiv Post | 20251229T103004 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 61%
- Documents obtained by analytics firm Dallas indicate that Houston-based energy giant SLB (formerly Schlumberger) continued transferring proprietary drilling technology to Russian manufacturers as recently as February 2025, weeks after new US sanctions targeting Russia's oil sector took effect. This activity, including detailed engineering drawings for critical oil extraction equipment components, raises concerns that SLB is undermining US sanctions and supporting Russia's war effort in Ukraine. Despite having promised to exit the Russian market years earlier, SLB's continued presence and deepening involvement suggest a long-term strategy rather than a withdrawal.

**3. ConocoPhillips Stock (COP) Outlook: Oil Slumps on Supply-Glut Fears, Analysts See $114–$121 Targets Ahead of Monday’s Open**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251228T214259 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 58%
- ConocoPhillips (COP) faces a mixed outlook as oil prices slump due to fears of a 2026 supply glut, even as the broader U.S. market is near record highs. Despite the cautious oil market, analysts maintain strong price targets for COP stock, ranging from $114-$121, highlighting the company's long-term potential in its low cost of supply, visible project growth, and commitment to shareholder returns. Investors are advised to monitor crude oil movements and ConocoPhillips' upcoming Q4 2025 earnings call on February 5, 2026, which will offer clarity on capital discipline and shareholder returns.
