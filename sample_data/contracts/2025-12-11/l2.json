Utilities leading from deep oversold conditions suggests defensive positioning ahead of Fed uncertainty, while materials, financials, and industrials maintaining uptrends indicates underlying economic stability.

  "l1_alignment": "Sector rotation aligns well with L1's NORMAL regime and moderate risk appetite. The mixed defensive/cyclical strength supports selective positioning rather than broad risk-taking, which matches the AGGRESSIVE bias tempered by Fed meeting uncertainty and elevated complacency (VIX 8th percentile).",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (MEDIUM confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias and 115% max size. Sector rotation shows mixed defensive/offensive signals which aligns with moderate risk appetite and Fed uncertainty.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll signals validated against v6.1 thresholds. Strong recovery in XLU from Zone C, multiple ignition signals in defensive sectors, trend continuation in cyclicals. No anomalies detected.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: C (XLU recovery), D (4 ignition signals), A (5 trend signals), E (1 neutral). Rotation shows defensive leadership with cyclical support - mixed directional bias.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo L1/L2 conflict. Mixed rotation (defensive + cyclical strength) aligns with NORMAL regime's moderate risk appetite ahead of Fed meeting uncertainty.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nEARLY_EXPANSION phase identified by simultaneous strength in defensive sectors (utilities, healthcare, consumer staples) and early cyclical leadership (materials, financials, industrials). This mixed pattern suggests transition from defensive positioning toward growth themes, typical of early expansion periods.\n\nKey Insight: The market is positioning defensively ahead of the Fed meeting while maintaining cyclical exposure, creating a balanced rotation that favors selective stock picking over broad sector bets."
