- The state-run Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) announced it will freeze electricity rates for the first quarter of next year, maintaining the adjusted unit fuel cost at 5 won per kilowatt-hour (kWh).

- Georgia Power, a subsidiary of The Southern Company (SO), has received approval for a major electric generation expansion aimed at meeting the increasing demand from data centers, particularly those supporting artificial intelligence development. The plan, estimated to cost $16.3 billion but potentially $50-$60 billion for customers over time, intends to spread fixed costs across a broader customer base, with large users like data centers bearing a disproportionate share. Critics, however, express skepticism about demand forecasts and raise concerns about financial risks for existing customers and environmental impacts from new natural gas plants.
