Wall Street analysts have largely positive sentiment with several firms raising price targets, leading to a "Moderate Buy" consensus rating and an average target of $91.42.

- Source: AD HOC NEWS | 20260103T070141 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Hasbro Inc. stock has seen a cautious rebound recently, attempting to recover from a significant slump, despite mixed Wall Street ratings and a choppy five-day trading pattern. While the stock remains well below its 52-week peak and has lagged the broader market over the past year, it is above its 52-week low, hinting that the most aggressive selling pressure may have passed. Investors are now watching to see if strategic shifts, cost-cutting, and stronger monetization of its intellectual property can convert this tentative stabilization into a sustained comeback story, or if it's merely a temporary pause in a volatile market.
