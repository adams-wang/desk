    - Summary: Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) has announced a 2025 share buyback program and secured regulatory approval for a Category 4 license in Abu Dhabi, aiming to expand its wholesale banking services in the Middle East. These initiatives reflect BBVA's dual focus on returning capital to shareholders and growing fee-based services in new markets. The article suggests that while these moves are positive, the near-term investment narrative will largely depend on how BBVA balances capital returns with managing macro shocks in emerging markets like Mexico and Turkey.
