- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251223T051013 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- |Allegro MicroSystems (ALGM) saw a 4% climb after Micron Technology's upbeat revenue forecast boosted the semiconductor sector, especially AI-exposed chipmakers.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning.

Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
