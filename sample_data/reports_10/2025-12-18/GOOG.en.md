**5. Alphabet Seizes Mag 7 Crown With 62% Stock Surge — But Amazon's Bargain Is The Plot Twist**
- Source: Sahm | 20251217T030928 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, NASDAQ: GOOGL) has significantly outpaced its fellow "Magnificent 7" stocks this year with a 62.26% surge, making it the top performer and solidifying its position among mega-cap companies. Conversely, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) has lagged dramatically with only a 1.05% year-to-date gain, but its consequently lower valuation metrics, like a price-to-sales ratio of 3.48, suggest it might be a bargain compared to its more expensive peers. This creates a contrasting narrative within Big Tech, where Alphabet wears the performance crown while Amazon quietly offers a potential deal.
