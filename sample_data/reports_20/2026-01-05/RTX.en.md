- RTX (NYSE: RTX) through its business Collins Aerospace has been awarded a $438 million FAA contract to modernize the U.S. National Airspace System. The contract involves delivering next-generation cooperative and non-cooperative radars, including the Condor Mk3 and ASR-XM, to replace legacy systems, enhancing safety and efficiency.

**3. UBS downgrades RTX stock rating to Neutral on fair valuation**
- Source: Investing.com | 20260105T120840 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- UBS has downgraded RTX Corp. (NYSE:RTX) from Buy to Neutral, lowering its price target slightly, citing a balanced risk/reward profile and fair valuation after the stock's significant gains. The firm notes that positive factors for RTX, like growth in its aerospace divisions and improving GTF engine figures, are already priced into the stock. While UBS forecasts continued EBITDA and EPS upside, it remains below consensus on 2026 free cash flow due to lingering GTF risk.

- RTX Corp shares saw an increase at the start of 2026, gaining 2.1% to $187.25, as investors showed renewed interest in aerospace and defense stocks. This comes as the market awaits crucial U.S. jobs data, inflation reports, and RTX's own earnings report later in January, which could influence interest rates and growth expectations. The defense sector is benefiting from increased global government spending and long-cycle backlogs, evidenced by RTX's recent $1.7 billion Patriot deal with Spain.
