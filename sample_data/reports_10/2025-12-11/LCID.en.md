-  Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) shares continued to fall on Tuesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to Underweight, citing an "EV winter" and concerns about Lucid's path to profitability. Analyst Andrew Percoco slashed his price target to $10 from $30, projecting the company won't reach gross profit breakeven until 2028 and may require a significant equity raise. This bearish outlook, compounded by high short interest and a recent executive departure, has pushed LCID near its 52-week low.

- Lucid Group (LCID) has experienced significant share price weakness despite growing revenue, with its stock down over the past month and year. While a newly announced partnership with Uber and Nuro for robotaxi deployment suggests substantial future growth and a narrative fair value of $18.43 (undervalued), the company faces challenges with persistent negative margins and a high price-to-sales ratio compared to its industry peers. Investors are left to weigh the potential for a growth story against execution risks and ambitious valuation assumptions.

Despite this slowdown, Lucid expects to produce around 18,000 EVs this year, meeting the lower end of its forecast. This comes as analysts downgrade Lucid, Rivian, and Tesla shares, anticipating an "EV winter" to continue through next year.
