-  Eversource Energy (ES) has seen an 11.28% share price pullback in the last month, despite positive year-to-date and 1-year total returns. This has led to a narrative suggesting the stock is 9.3% undervalued, with a fair value estimate of $72.73 compared to its last close of $65.97.

- Eversource Energy (ES) has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.7525 per share, matching its previous payout, resulting in a forward yield of 4.56%.

- Eversource Energy has appealed the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s (PURA) rejection of its $2.4 billion sale of Aquarion Water to the Aquarion Water Authority and South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority. The lawsuit argues that PURA's rejection was legally incorrect and seeks to reverse the decision, remanding it with instructions to approve the transaction. The proposed sale aims to shift Aquarion to a not-for-profit model, which proponents claim would benefit customers through lower bills and improved system reliability.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite persisting. Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
