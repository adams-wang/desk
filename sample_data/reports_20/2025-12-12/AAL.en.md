- Former American Airlines CEO Doug Parker provided a detailed analysis of airline pricing strategies, emphasizing revenue management over cost-cutting as the primary profit engine. He highlighted the evolution of fare fences like Basic Economy to segment customers and maximize revenue, arguing that airlines like Delta, United, and American will converge on a multi-tier premium model.
