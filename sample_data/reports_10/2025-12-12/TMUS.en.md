- T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) stock dropped to a new 52-week low on December 9, 2025, after a price target cut from Argus Research, ongoing sector pressures, and a busy schedule of corporate updates. Despite the near-term weakness and oversold sentiment, analysts largely maintain a "Buy" rating with price targets significantly above current levels, indicating a disconnect between market behavior and fundamental valuations. Investors should watch for overnight news, pre-market trading around the $199-$200 support level, and broader sector performance before the December 10, 2025 market open.

- Morgan Stanley has named T-Mobile its top pick in the U.S. wireless industry, maintaining an "overweight" rating due to its strong brand, spectrum position, and customer satisfaction. The brokerage also remains "overweight" on AT&T, confident in its long-term guidance, but maintains an "equal-weight" rating on Verizon amidst its strategic revamp. Morgan Stanley has, however, cut price targets for all three companies: AT&T to $30, Verizon to $47, and T-Mobile to $260.
