### Key Risks

1. Volume divergence: price rising (+0.4% MRS) on declining volume (67% of avg) suggests distribution.
2. Valuation risk: PEG 5.4x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
3. Elevated short interest (12.6%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
