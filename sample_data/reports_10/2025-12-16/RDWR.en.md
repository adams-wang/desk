The analyst suggests that cybersecurity software companies, including Radware, are expected to remain resilient in 2026 due to strong fundamentals, but may not experience a significant rebound driven by AI.

- Radware cybersecurity specialists predict that 2026 will see a significant shift towards an "Internet of Agents," where machine-to-machine activity, automated agents, and AI will dominate internet traffic, threat landscapes, and defense strategies. This shift will make APIs the primary attack surface and intensify AI-enhanced social engineering and denial-of-service attacks. Consequently, regulatory demands will tighten, and there will be a greater focus on zero-day vulnerabilities, runtime security, and machine identities for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity measures.
