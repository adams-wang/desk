- This article summarizes a bullish thesis on FedEx Corporation (FDX) by David J. Waldron, emphasizing the company's economic moat, strong owners' earnings growth, and robust shareholder returns. Despite past underperformance in revenue growth and net profit margins compared to the S&P 500, FedEx maintains market leadership and offers potential for long-term investors through dividends, capital appreciation, and exposure to a resilient logistics platform.
