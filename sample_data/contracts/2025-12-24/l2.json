This creates a bifurcated market where quality growth and financial sectors benefit from year-end flows and stable macro conditions, while rate-sensitive and commodity-exposed sectors face headwinds.

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (MEDIUM confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias aligns well with sector rotation showing TREND signals in XLF/XLC. However, 7 sectors in WEAKENING/AVOID zones suggests more selectivity than broad risk-on positioning would imply.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nPre-calculated signals validated: 2 TREND, 2 NEUTRAL, 3 WEAKENING, 4 AVOID. No anomalies detected in MRS_20/MRS_5/ROC_3 thresholds. Zone classifications consistent with empirical rules.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: A (2 sectors - XLF, XLC trending), E (2 sectors - XLK, XLV neutral), B (3 sectors - XLI, XLB, XLY weakening), D (4 sectors - XLRE, XLE, XLU, XLP avoiding). Rotation direction mixed with financial/communication leading.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nMinor conflict between L1 AGGRESSIVE bias and sector concentration in weak zones resolved by recognizing year-end positioning dynamics and VIX at cycle lows supporting selective risk-taking in quality sectors while avoiding laggards.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nEarly expansion phase identified based on financial services leadership combined with technology stability, while traditional cyclicals show mixed performance and defensives underperform. This pattern suggests economy moving past initial recovery phase but not yet in full mid-cycle expansion where broad cyclical leadership would dominate.\n\nKey Insight: Market showing clear bifurcation between quality growth/financial leaders and broad sector weakness, suggesting selective risk-taking is more appropriate than broad aggressive positioning despite constructive macro backdrop."
