- Wynn Resorts (WYNN) is drawing attention after recent price movements. The company is currently trading at $122.57, which Simply Wall St identifies as a 24.5% intrinsic discount, making its fair value $143.33.

**2. Assessing Wynn Resorts (WYNN) Valuation After Recent Price Consolidation And Macau UAE Growth Narrative**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T160855 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Wynn Resorts (WYNN) has seen recent price consolidation, leading to questions about its valuation. The company is considered 14.5% undervalued with a narrative fair value of $143.33, driven by high-end customer resilience, Macau normalization, and UAE development. However, its current P/E ratio of 25x is higher than the industry average, suggesting the market might already be pricing in future growth.

**3. MGM Resorts extends branding partnership with MGM China**
- Source: Yogonet | 20260105T150426 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- MGM Resorts International has extended its branding agreement with MGM China Holdings Limited, effective January 1, 2026, increasing the monthly license fee from 1.75% to 3.5% of MGM China's adjusted consolidated net monthly revenues. This long-term agreement secures the MGM brand for MGM China through 2032 and potentially until 2045, safeguarding a key intangible asset. While beneficial for MGM Resorts and Pansy Ho, some analysts project a short-term negative impact on MGM China's EBITDA due to the doubled fees.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
