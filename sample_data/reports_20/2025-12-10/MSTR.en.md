### Key Risks

1. High beta (3.41) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Insider selling cluster: $5.2M in recent transactions.
3. Valuation risk: PEG 3.1x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
4. Elevated short interest (10.3%): bears positioning against stock.
5. Long-term trend broken: trading 43.8% below SMA200.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
