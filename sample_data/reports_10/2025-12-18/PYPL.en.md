**1. PayPal: The Bank Charter Changes Things, But I Still Remain Bullish (NASDAQ:PYPL)**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251217T195613 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- PayPal Holdings, Inc.'s recent bank charter application contradicts the prior asset-light argument, but the author remains bullish. Securing an ILC charter could yield funding cost arbitrage on SMB loans, potentially boosting operating margins despite balance sheet concerns. While new regulatory capital requirements will impact share buybacks and short-term ROE, the author believes this transition ultimately reinforces a Buy rating at 11.3x forward earnings.

This move aims to allow PayPal to offer small-business lending, interest-bearing deposit accounts, and potentially join US card networks, reducing its reliance on third-party lenders and strengthening its financial ecosystem. If approved, PayPal Bank's deposits would be FDIC insured, and it would operate as a regulated financial institution, with former Toyota Financial Savings Bank CEO Mara McNeill appointed as its president.
