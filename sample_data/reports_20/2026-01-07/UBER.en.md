- The article discusses Uber Technologies stock, noting its recent bumpy ride with a 15% increase since March, trailing the S&P 500. Despite market concerns about profit margins, the author believes the picture will improve, advising investors to hold onto the stock as it is undervalued due to headwinds and a discounted autonomous vehicle business.

- Electric automaker Lucid Group, autonomous driving technology developer Nuro, and Uber Technologies have unveiled a production-intent robotaxi at CES. This robotaxi, based on the Lucid Gravity SUV and featuring Nuro’s autonomous driving technology, is designed for Uber's ride-hailing network. The companies plan to deploy up to 20,000 of these EVs in the San Francisco Bay Area and other global markets over the next six years, with on-road testing already underway.

**3. TomTom and Uber strengthen ties to enhance on-demand travel experiences globally**

- TomTom and Uber have renewed their partnership to integrate TomTom's maps, Maps APIs, and live services across Uber's global platform. This collaboration aims to improve Uber's routing, fare calculations, and pick-up/drop-off accuracy, especially in complex environments, by leveraging TomTom's continuously updated mapping platform. The partnership creates a feedback loop where real-world data from Uber trips helps refine TomTom's maps, thereby enhancing the user experience for both companies' customers.

**4. Uber stock slides as CES robotaxi debut collides with fresh Wall Street downgrade**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260106T004826 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Uber's stock slid 2.56% to $80.74 following the unveiling of a "production-intent" robotaxi at CES and a downgrade to Sell from Melius Research. The decline reflects investor concerns over intensifying driverless-car competition and Uber's long-term economics as a "demand aggregator" in the robotaxi space. The company faces scrutiny over how much of each fare it can retain when autonomous technology owners gain leverage.

**5. Uber stock slips on Melius “Sell” call as robotaxi competition looms in 2026**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20260105T152700 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Uber shares experienced a 1.9% decline after Melius Research downgraded the stock to "Sell" with a $73 price target, citing increasing autonomous vehicle (AV) competition expected in 2026 and beyond. Melius warned that intensified AV competition could negatively impact Uber's returns and pricing power, even with the company's strategic partnerships. Investors are now awaiting Uber's February 4th earnings report for updates on its margins and autonomy strategy amid these competitive concerns.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
