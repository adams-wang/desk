## Sector Analysis

### Executive Summary
Cycle phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (LOW confidence). Rotation bias: NEUTRAL. Key insight: Despite improving macro conditions and VIX at 52-week lows, sector rotation remains constrained by narrow participation and mixed fundamentals, creating a disconnect between L1's aggressive stance and L2's neutral positioning that favors selectivity over broad sector bets.

### Market Narrative
- Weakness in Energy, Real Estate, Utilities: Fleet management contracts, renewable energy projects, automotive earnings, infrastructure partnerships; Potential breakout scenarios, data center REIT exposure, cap rate compression, short interest dynamics.

### Rotation Summary
The rotation landscape shows a market in transition, with no clear offensive or defensive leadership emerging. Technology maintains its relative strength in the noise zone, supported by AI adoption themes and S&P 500 additions. Healthcare shows resilience despite recent weakness, buoyed by strong news sentiment around drug approvals and digital health innovations. However, previously strong sectors like Industrials, Materials, and Financials are showing early warning signs with negative 5-day momentum despite positive 20-day positioning. The defensive sectors (Utilities, Consumer Staples) are failing to attract capital despite their traditional safe-haven characteristics, while Energy and Real Estate remain in avoidance territory. This mixed rotation pattern suggests market participants are being selective rather than making broad sector bets.

### L1 Alignment
L1's NORMAL regime with AGGRESSIVE bias suggests risk-on conditions, but L2's NEUTRAL rotation bias reflects the reality of narrow market participation and mixed sector momentum. The disconnect indicates that while macro conditions are supportive, sector-specific factors and selectivity are dominating rotation patterns. This aligns with L1's observation of improving but narrow breadth recovery.
