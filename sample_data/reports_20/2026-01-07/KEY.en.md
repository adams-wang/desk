- Baird đã hạ xếp hạng cổ phiếu KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY) từ "Trung lập" xuống "Kém hiệu quả" nhưng vẫn giữ nguyên giá mục tiêu 18 USD, mặc dù cổ phiếu này hiện giao dịch ở mức 21,37 USD. Việc hạ xếp hạng này được đưa ra sau khi giá cổ phiếu tăng 15% kể từ ngày 30 tháng 9, điều mà Baird cho rằng vượt quá các cải thiện cơ bản của công ty. KeyCorp đang giao dịch ở mức cao nhất trong 52 tuần, với tỷ lệ P/E là 24,77 và tỷ suất cổ tức 3,84%, nhưng nhà phân tích David George của Baird coi hồ sơ rủi ro/lợi nhuận là "không hấp dẫn" do định giá hiện tại.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
