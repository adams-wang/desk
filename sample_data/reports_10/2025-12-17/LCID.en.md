- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251216T185400 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Lucid Group (LCID) has been upgraded to a "Buy" due to improved liquidity, extending through Q1 2027 with $5.5 billion in capacity, and reduced FY25 capital expenditure forecasts. The company demonstrated strong delivery growth, up 47% year-over-year in Q3, outperforming competitors like Tesla and Rivian, which suggests increasing brand momentum ahead of its mid-size SUV launch.
