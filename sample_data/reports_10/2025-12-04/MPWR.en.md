**3. Vicor Corporation (VICR): A Bull Case Theory**
- Source: Finviz | 20251204T135800 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 60%
- This article presents a bullish thesis on Vicor Corporation (VICR), highlighting its strong financial position with $1 billion in U.S. manufacturing capacity and no debt, along with a significant cash reserve. The company is poised for substantial revenue growth from a major hyperscaler contract and two OEM deals, complemented by increasing high-margin licensing revenue. VICR's operational improvements, small free float, and potential as an M&A target suggest considerable upside, despite current conservative estimates and a low valuation relative to its growth prospects.
