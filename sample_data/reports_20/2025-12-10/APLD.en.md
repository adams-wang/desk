-  Institutional investors are the largest shareholders in Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD), owning approximately 59% of the company. Their significant ownership means the stock price is sensitive to their trading actions, and they benefited greatly from an 11% stock price increase last week, extending their one-year return to 228%. While institutional ownership lends credibility, the presence of various ownership groups, including the public and private companies, adds complexity to the company's control structure.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
