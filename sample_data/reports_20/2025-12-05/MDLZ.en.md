- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251204T100823 | Neutral | Relevance: 65%
- Conagra Brands (CAG) has experienced a tough year with its stock price sliding despite modest profit growth, leading to an interesting valuation discussion. The company is considered 15.1% undervalued with a narrative fair value of $20.22, primarily due to expected operational efficiencies from stabilizing supply chains and an incremental 53rd week in fiscal '26. However, this upside depends on inflation and regulatory pressures remaining contained.
