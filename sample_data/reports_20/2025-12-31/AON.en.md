- Source: Beinsure | 20251230T160753 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 73%
- Howden US refutes allegations of trade-secret theft and unfair competition from Brown & Brown, claiming that mass employee departures were due to Brown & Brown's poor corporate culture, low compensation, and management issues.

- Howden US has responded to a lawsuit filed by Brown & Brown, claiming that employees left Brown & Brown due to "mistreatment" and "terrible management" rather than a "pirate raid." Howden US asserts that the employees were unhappy with their former employer's corporate culture, compensation, and reporting, and denies allegations of trade secret theft or unfair competition. Howden US also highlights that Jim Hays, a former Brown & Brown executive now with Howden Group Holdings, is a plaintiff in the case despite being accused of complicity in the alleged poaching, and claims Hays' financial interest in Brown & Brown makes the allegations against him illogical.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
