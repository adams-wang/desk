**1. Momentum Accelerates as Rocket Lab Expands Defense Footprint on Multibillion SDA Deal**
- Source: AD HOC NEWS | 20260105T070853 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Rocket Lab USA is entering 2026 with strong momentum, establishing itself as a Prime Contractor for government defense programs, beyond its traditional role as a niche launch-service provider. A key catalyst is an $816 million U.S. Space Development Agency (SDA) contract to design and build 18 satellites for missile threat tracking, significantly expanding its defense footprint. Investors are closely watching updates on the Neutron program and progress on the SDA satellite constellation, especially given the company's recent stock surge and optimistic market capitalization.

**2. Cantor Fitzgerald reiterates Overweight rating on Rocket Lab stock**
- Source: Investing.com | 20260105T140915 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Cantor Fitzgerald has reiterated an "Overweight" rating and a $72.00 price target for Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB), citing recent achievements and future catalysts. The company completed a record 21 Electron launches in fiscal year 2025 and secured an $805 million contract with the Space Development Agency, significantly expanding its backlog. The upcoming Neutron launch in Q1 2026 is anticipated to be a major catalyst for the company.

**3. Why Rocket Lab’s Sky-High Valuation Is a Big Risk in 2026**
- Source: 24/7 Wall St. | 20260105T180915 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 99%
- Rocket Lab's valuation is soaring due to renewed interest in space stocks and a record year for Electron missions, but its future hinges on the Neutron rocket's successful and timely debut. Delays and intense competition from SpaceX, which boasts larger capacities and aggressive pricing, pose significant risks. Despite a large backlog and forecasted revenue growth, the current valuation at 48 times forward revenue is precarious given potential setbacks and ongoing cash burn.
