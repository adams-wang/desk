This dividend hike, effective January 21, 2026, reflects management's confidence in the company's cash generation and commitment to returning income to shareholders. While the increase solidifies Erie Indemnity's appeal to income investors, it doesn't fundamentally alter its investment narrative, which remains tied to its agency-focused model, steady revenue growth, and underwriting discipline.

| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
