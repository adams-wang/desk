- While Novo Nordisk initially led the GLP-1 weight loss market, Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro are now outperforming it significantly. The article suggests that Pfizer, despite past setbacks and patent expirations, could be a better contrarian investment due to its aggressive re-entry into the GLP-1 space through acquisitions and partnerships, and its lower valuation metrics compared to Novo Nordisk. However, investors should note Pfizer's high dividend payout ratio, indicating it's more of a turnaround play than a reliable dividend stock.
