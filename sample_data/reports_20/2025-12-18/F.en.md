- Ford Motor Co. is shifting away from its ambitious electric vehicle aspirations due to significant financial losses and declining consumer interest. The company plans to focus more on efficient gasoline engines and hybrid electric vehicles, as evidenced by the discontinuation of the all-electric F-150 Lightning and the repurposing of its EV manufacturing facilities. This strategic change aims to achieve a more profitable and resilient Ford, with a target of hybrids, extended-range EVs, and full EVs accounting for half of its global volume by 2030.
