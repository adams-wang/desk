-  Rocket Lab stock (RKLB) has rebounded from a 27% crash, with Wall Street analysts raising price targets to over $65 due to a transformative 2026 outlook. Despite recent volatility and a delay in the Neutron rocket's first launch, the company's strong Q3 2025 earnings, record revenue, and a substantial $1.1 billion backlog are fueling bullish sentiment. Analysts view the recent selloff as fear-driven rather than fundamental, expecting significant growth and potential unlocking of the medium-lift market if the Neutron rocket succeeds in its planned Q1 2026 launch.
