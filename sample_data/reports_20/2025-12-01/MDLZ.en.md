-  Cocoa futures have dropped to a two-year low, offering a rare margin tailwind for chocolate manufacturers ahead of the holiday season, typically a peak demand period. This decline could allow companies like Hershey and Mondelez to improve profitability or offer discounts, potentially leading to bullish outcomes for their stocks. However, the drop also reflects softening global demand, meaning sustained investor confidence will depend on real unit-growth evidence rather than just seasonal boosts.
