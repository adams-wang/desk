**2. Omnicom Group (OMC): Has the Recent Pullback Opened Up a Valuation Opportunity?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251210T190833 | Bullish | Relevance: 99%
-  Omnicom Group (OMC) has experienced a 6% pullback over the past three months, leading to questions about whether its current price reflects its underlying fundamentals. Despite negative shareholder returns over the past year, the company continues to show solid growth, and a recent narrative suggests it is significantly undervalued at $73.24 compared to a fair value of $100.56. This potential undervaluation is driven by disciplined cost management, operational restructuring, and anticipated synergies from the Interpublic deal, alongside workforce and efficiency initiatives.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
