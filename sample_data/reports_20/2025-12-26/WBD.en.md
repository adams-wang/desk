- A fierce battle has erupted for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), with Netflix (NFLX) and Paramount Skydance (PSKY) leading the charge. Paramount has launched a hostile $108 billion bid for Warner Bros. Discovery's media assets after Warner Bros. opted for Netflix's $82.7 billion offer, turning the acquisition into a high-stakes media war.

- Source: New York Post | 20251224T070850 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 95%
- Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, has committed a personal guarantee of up to $40.4 billion to support his son David Ellison's Paramount Skydance bid for Warner Bros. Discovery. This significant financial backing is an attempt to salvage the bid, which Warner Bros. Discovery had previously rejected due to concerns about financial reliability. The move places a substantial portion of Ellison's $250 billion fortune at risk, potentially forcing him to sell Oracle shares, a strategy he has largely avoided.
