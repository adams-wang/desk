**1. Tesla Stock Rises to First Record of 2025**
- Source: The Wall Street Journal | 20251216T220912 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Tesla's shares climbed 3.1% on Tuesday, hitting their first record high of 2025 and pushing its market capitalization to $1.629 trillion. This rally allowed Tesla to surpass Broadcom, becoming the seventh-largest U.S. company by market cap, coinciding with Ford's retrenchment in the EV sector and investor focus on Tesla's robotaxi developments.

**2. Tesla Stock (TSLA) Near Record High as Robotaxi “No-Occupant” Testing Ignites Fresh Bull Case Forecasts**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251216T150858 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Tesla (TSLA) stock is nearing a record high due to progress in its robotaxi testing, specifically the introduction of "no-occupant" autonomous vehicles in Austin, Texas. This development has reignited the debate about Tesla's valuation as an AI and robotics platform rather than solely an automaker, leading to bullish forecasts from analysts like Wedbush's Daniel Ives, who predicts a $2-3 trillion market cap by 2026. However, skepticism remains due to Waymo's established lead in commercial robotaxi deployments, questions about Tesla's safety data transparency, and the ongoing challenge of weak U.S. EV sales despite autonomy excitement.

**3. Tesla: Shares Rally on Robotaxi Testing Without Safety Monitor**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251215T222830 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Tesla's shares rallied 4% after CEO Elon Musk announced robotaxi testing in Austin, Texas, without safety monitors. While this signals progress in its autonomous driving technology, Morningstar maintains a "Very High" uncertainty rating and a $300 fair value estimate, viewing current market valuation for Tesla's robotaxi business as too high. Morningstar projects a full U.S. robotaxi launch by 2028, expecting Tesla to achieve a 30% market share in ride-hailing, but with smaller profits due to pricing pressures.

**4. Tesla stock closes at 2025 high after Musk confirms driverless Robotaxi tests underway in Austin**
- Source: CNBC | 20251215T210830 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Tesla's stock reached a 2025 high after CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company is testing driverless Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, without human occupants. This development follows the launch of a limited Robotaxi service with safety drivers in June. Despite the positive stock movement, Tesla's self-driving technology has faced scrutiny, particularly regarding minor collisions reported in their Austin fleet and its slower pace compared to competitors.

**5. Tesla directors earned over $3 billion from stock awards, analysis shows**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251215T160830 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- An analysis by Equilar reveals that Tesla directors have earned over $3 billion from stock awards, significantly more than directors at other major U.S. tech companies. This substantial compensation, with individuals like Kimbal Musk, Ira Ehrenpreis, and Robyn Denholm receiving hundreds of millions, has drawn scrutiny. The issue highlights ongoing concerns about Tesla's governance and executive pay, especially after a court annulled Elon Musk's 2018 pay package.
