- Sandisk has officially joined the S&P 500 index after experiencing a significant surge in its stock value this year, driven by demand from the AI boom. The company's shares are up over 500% since its spin-off from Western Digital in February, pushing its market capitalization above $31 billion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 is often seen as a positive catalyst for a company's shares, and this move follows the acquisition of Interpublic Group by Omnicom Group, which opened a spot in the index.
