**1. Tesla Downgraded by Morgan Stanley on Valuation Concerns**
- Source: TradingView | 20251208T150903 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
-  Morgan Stanley downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Equal Weight from Overweight, citing valuation concerns that already reflect most expected gains from its artificial intelligence initiatives. The firm set a $425 price target, noting that while Tesla remains strong, optimism around its non-auto businesses limits risk-reward. The updated valuation incorporates higher long-term assumptions for Full Self Driving and network services, but lowers auto valuation due to reduced volume estimates amid slower EV adoption and rising competition.

**2. Elon Musk Calls Cybertruck Tesla's 'Best Ever' — But Sales Say Otherwise**

- Despite Elon Musk's claims that the Cybertruck is Tesla's "best ever" vehicle, sales data tells a different story. Tesla sold only 5,385 Cybertruck units in the U.S. in Q3 2025, a significant 62.6% year-over-year decline, and reports suggest tens of thousands remain unsold. This comes amid a broader decline in EV demand, with other automakers like Ford and General Motors also scaling back EV production.

-  A new nationwide class action lawsuit has been filed against Tesla Inc., alleging that the company knowingly sold defective Powerwall 2 battery systems. The lawsuit claims these systems have a defect that can cause them to overheat, emit smoke, or catch fire, and that Tesla's subsequent recall of the units was inadequate, leaving consumers without the full functionality they paid for. The plaintiff is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages for a class of affected consumers.

**4. Tesla Stock (TSLA) Today: Morgan Stanley Downgrade, China Sales Twist and 2026 AI Bet – December 9, 2025**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251209T140846 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares are under scrutiny after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to "Equal Weight" despite raising its price target to $425, citing that the AI and robotaxi upside is largely priced in. The company faces mixed results in China, with November shipments up but year-to-date retail sales down, while Q3 2025 saw record revenue and free cash flow but compressed margins. Wall Street analysts maintain a cautious outlook, with price targets averaging around $385–$400, though some bullish firms still foresee significant upside driven by Tesla's long-term AI, robotics, and energy ambitions.

- Source: Benzinga | 20251208T130846 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco downgraded Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) from "overweight" to "equal-weight" while raising the price target to $425. Despite Tesla's strong position in the EV market and diverse business, Percoco believes the stock is overvalued and forecasts a "choppy trading environment" through 2026. This downgrade aligns with growing skepticism about Tesla's valuation from other financial experts.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
