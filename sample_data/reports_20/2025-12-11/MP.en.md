- MP Materials, the sole operator of a scalable rare earth mine in the U.S., is crucial to the White House's plan for a domestic supply of rare earth elements. The company is poised to begin shipping U.S.-made high-performance magnets by late 2025, with further expansion plans into 2026, including a heavy rare-earth separation facility.

The sale, which generated between $50,000 and $100,000, occurred after the government's support caused MP Materials' stock price to skyrocket.

These developments are expected to drive profitability and reduce US dependency on foreign critical mineral sources.
