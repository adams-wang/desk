### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 4.8% to 3.5% (-1.2% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 0.5pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 at 0.6% confirms short-term momentum alignment. AM_20 at 4.0% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI overbought at 75, risk of mean reversion. Volume at 52% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +DUL (Resistance).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
