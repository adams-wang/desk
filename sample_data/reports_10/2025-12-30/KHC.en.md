- Kraft Heinz (KHC) currently offers a 6.6% dividend yield, making it an attractive option for income investors, especially given its strong free cash flow that comfortably covers dividend payments. Despite a stock pullback and declining sales, the company's shares are trading at a cheap valuation of eight times trailing-12-month free cash flow. This, combined with meaningful share repurchases and upcoming structural changes, suggests the stock might be a compelling buy for long-term dividend investors willing to accept some risk.
