**2. Lamb Weston Holdings Inc (NYSE:LW) EBITDA Declines**
- Source: FXDailyReport.Com | 20251219T190820 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Lamb Weston Holdings Inc (NYSE:LW) experienced a stock plunge of 24.76% after reporting a modest earnings beat for its fiscal second quarter but reaffirming full-year guidance in a way that concerned investors. The company's adjusted gross profit and EBITDA both decreased due to weaker price/mix and elevated manufacturing costs, despite strong volume growth in North America and Asia. Lamb Weston still expects net sales between $6.35 billion and $6.55 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $1.00 billion to $1.20 billion for the full year.

**3. Why Lamb Weston Stock Is Plummeting Today**
- Source: Finviz | 20251219T170539 | Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Shares of Lamb Weston (NYSE: LW), a leading frozen potato supplier, plummeted 22% after the company provided underwhelming earnings and guidance. Despite a 1% sales growth and adjusted earnings per share of $0.69 during the second quarter, management's full-year guidance for flat revenue and an 11% decline in adjusted EBITDA spooked the market. The company saw an increase in sales volume but this was offset by an 8% drop in pricing mix due to strong potato crops and weakness in the quick-service restaurant industry.

**4. Lamb Weston shares tumble 12% despite beating Q2 earnings, revenue estimates**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251219T140839 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) shares fell 12.7% despite exceeding analyst expectations for Q2 fiscal 2026 adjusted EPS and revenue. The company maintained its full-year guidance and increased its quarterly dividend, but a decline in price/mix and slightly lower Adjusted EBITDA contributed to the stock's downturn. Volume growth in North America and Asia, driven by customer wins, partially offset challenges in a competitive global market.

**5. Lamb Weston (NYSE:LW) Beats Q4 CY2025 Sales Expectations But Stock Drops**
- Source: Finviz | 20251219T140833 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Lamb Weston (NYSE:LW) reported Q4 CY2025 results that exceeded revenue expectations with sales up 1.1% year-on-year to $1.62 billion, and adjusted EPS of $0.69 beat analyst estimates by 6.4%. Despite these positive results and an 8% jump in sales volumes, the company's full-year revenue and EBITDA guidance came in below analysts' estimates, causing the stock to drop immediately after the announcement. The market's disappointment with the guidance seems to be weighing on shares.
