- IDEX (IEX) has seen an 11% share price rebound over the last three months, despite negative year-to-date and one-year returns, prompting a fresh look at its valuation. The company is considered 9% undervalued with a narrative fair value around $190s, based on expected earnings growth to $698.2 million by Sept 2028. However, an "Another View" perspective suggests caution, as its current PE ratio of 27.7x is richer than peers and a fair ratio.
