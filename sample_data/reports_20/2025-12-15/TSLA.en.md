- Tesla's shares rallied 4% after CEO Elon Musk announced robotaxi testing in Austin, Texas, without safety monitors. While this signals progress in its autonomous driving technology, Morningstar maintains a "Very High" uncertainty rating and a $300 fair value estimate, viewing current market valuation for Tesla's robotaxi business as too high. Morningstar projects a full U.S. robotaxi launch by 2028, expecting Tesla to achieve a 30% market share in ride-hailing, but with smaller profits due to pricing pressures.

This development follows the launch of a limited Robotaxi service with safety drivers in June.

- Tesla shares surged today on news of "no-occupant" robotaxi testing in Austin, which was confirmed by CEO Elon Musk, suggesting a more aggressive testing phase for its autonomous technology. This surge comes amidst ongoing scrutiny over board compensation, current U.S. sales figures indicating a tougher demand environment for its core car business, and new bullish 2026 forecasts from analysts like Wedbush, who see Tesla as an AI platform. Investors are weighing the potential of autonomy against regulatory risks and the company's financial performance.

- Tesla is facing a split narrative as it closes out 2025: while robotaxi ambitions fuel investor optimism and keep the stock resilient, the company is contending with slowing EV sales in key markets like the U.S. and Europe. Analysts are divided, with consensus price targets below current stock levels, focusing on whether autonomy and robotics can deliver tangible, high-margin revenue to offset challenges in its core automotive business. The upcoming year 2026 is seen as pivotal for Tesla to demonstrate measurable progress in both its traditional sales and futuristic ventures.
