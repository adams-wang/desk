3. Insider selling cluster: $3.3M in recent transactions.
4. High short interest (15.7%, 4.5 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.
5. Near-term weakness: 8.1% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 3 raises (avg +47%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

Insider selling cluster ($3.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (5 buying vs 5 selling).

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
