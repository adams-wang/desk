- Novo Nordisk has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. FDA for CagriSema, a once-weekly injection combining cagrilintide and semaglutide for weight management in adults with obesity or overweight. This investigational fixed-dose combination aims to be the first injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist and amylin analogue combination treatment.

- Oral GLP-1 obesity medications from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are anticipated to launch in 2026, offering a more convenient and potentially cheaper alternative to injections for some patients. While not expected to be more effective than existing injections, these pills could expand treatment options and reach those hesitant about needles. Both companies are preparing for high demand, with Goldman Sachs forecasting a significant market share for pills in the global weight loss drug market by 2030.
