**2. Is Ensign Group (NASDAQ:ENSG) Using Too Much Debt?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260105T000915 | Neutral | Relevance: 64%
- The Ensign Group has approximately US$142.7m in debt but maintains a net cash position of US$363.6m due to its US$506.3m cash reserves. While total liabilities are significant at US$1.98b more than current assets, the company's large market capitalization of US$10.0b and a 44% boost in EBIT suggest its debt usage is not overly risky. The ability to convert 71% of EBIT to free cash flow further strengthens its financial stability.
