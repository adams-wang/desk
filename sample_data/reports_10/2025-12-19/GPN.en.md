**5. NewtekOne, Inc. (NASDAQ:NEWT) Surges 26% Yet Its Low P/E Is No Reason For Excitement**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251219T101020 | Neutral | Relevance: 59%
- NewtekOne, Inc. has seen a 26% surge in its share price over the past month, but its low P/E ratio of 6.1x might not necessarily be a positive signal. Analysts anticipate a 0.3% contraction in EPS for the coming year, which explains the low P/E compared to the market's expected 16% growth. Despite the recent price bounce, shareholders are still down 3.8% over the last year, suggesting that the weak outlook is weighing down the shares.
