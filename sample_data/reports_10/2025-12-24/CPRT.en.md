**5. Did Qualivian’s Exit on Insurance Pressures Just Shift Copart's (CPRT) Investment Narrative?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251224T025533 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- Qualivian Investment Partners recently exited its position in Copart (CPRT) due to increased competition and softening volumes from the insurance sector, which accounts for 80% of Copart's revenue. This move highlights how shifts in insurer relationships and aggressive pricing from competitors like IAA can impact Copart's core business. While Copart's recent Q1 FY2026 results showed increased revenue and net income, the growing risk of insurers redirecting business to lower-cost rivals remains a significant concern for investors despite the company's ongoing investments in digital auctions and service breadth.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
