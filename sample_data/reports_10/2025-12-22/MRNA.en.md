**1. CEPI to Fund Pivotal Phase 3 Trial for Moderna's mRNA Pandemic Influenza Vaccine Candidate**
- Source: Florida Today | 20251222T180854 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) will invest up to $54.3 million to support a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for Moderna's mRNA-based H5 pandemic influenza vaccine candidate, mRNA-1018. This funding aims to accelerate the vaccine to licensure, bolstering global pandemic preparedness and ensuring equitable access, with Moderna allocating 20% of its manufacturing capacity to low- and middle-income countries. The trial, set to begin in early 2026, will build upon positive Phase 1/2 results, aiming to revolutionize pandemic response through the speed and adaptability of mRNA technology.
