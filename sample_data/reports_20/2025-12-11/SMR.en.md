**1. NuScale Power Plunges 20% in a Month: Time to Hold Tight or Exit?**
- Source: TradingView | 20251210T150834 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
-  NuScale Power (SMR) shares have dropped over 20% in the last month, underperforming its industry due to weaker-than-expected Q3 2025 results and concerns over Fluor's plan to divest its stake. The company faces significant competition and large upfront investments for its small modular reactor projects, with meaningful revenues still years away. Given these challenges and a stretched valuation, the stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).
