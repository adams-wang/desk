3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 10.06 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (margin 18%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (48.7x), $8.2B free cash flow. Insider selling cluster ($54.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 4 selling).

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
