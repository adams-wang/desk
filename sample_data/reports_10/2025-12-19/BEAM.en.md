- Beam Therapeutics has released new safety and efficacy data from its BEACON Phase 1/2 trial for risto-cel in sickle cell disease, leading to a recent stock price increase. While some analysts believe the company is significantly undervalued with a potential fair value of $65 per share, based on its lead assets, others point to its high price-to-sales ratio compared to the biotech industry average, suggesting it may be overvalued.
