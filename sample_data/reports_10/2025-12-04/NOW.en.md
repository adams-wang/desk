- ServiceNow (NOW) closed on December 4, 2025, at $834.02, reflecting a 0.13% gain amidst a busy period for the company including a planned 5-for-1 stock split and the acquisition of identity-security specialist Veza.

- ServiceNow is acquiring Veza, an AI-native identity security provider, to expand its security and risk portfolio and address the increasing complexity of enterprise identities due to AI adoption. This acquisition is expected to bolster ServiceNow's top-line growth, although its subscription revenue growth guidance for 2025 indicates a slower pace than previous years, partly due to tightening U.S. federal agency budgets.
