- Baird has maintained an Outperform rating on Oracle (ORCL) but adjusted its target price from $365 to $315, citing concerns over Oracle's debt and AI capacity. Oracle is reportedly amassing significant debt, including $30 billion with SoftBank and CoreWeave, to invest in OpenAI's data centers, with an additional $38 billion loan for further expansion. While Oracle aims to provide computing power to OpenAI at lower prices, the market has reacted with a shed in its market cap, prompting some to question the company's financial strategy despite its potential in AI.
