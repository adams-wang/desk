- US stocks saw little change in the week ending December 19, despite significant economic releases. The November jobs report indicated labor market weakness, while the CPI suggested easing inflation, though the latter was largely dismissed by markets due to government shutdown distortions. With the holiday season approaching, market activity naturally slowed.

**3. Tesla: Delaware Supreme Court Reinstates CEO Musk’s 2018 Pay Package**
- Source: Morningstar | 20251222T163105 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 65%
- The Delaware Supreme Court overturned a lower court's ruling that had voided Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 pay package, causing Tesla shares to rise. Morningstar maintains its $300 fair value estimate for Tesla, viewing the shares as overvalued but noting the reinstated pay package reduces key-person risk regarding Musk's departure. The compensation package, entirely share-based, is seen as crucial for retaining Musk and aligning with his desire for increased ownership.
