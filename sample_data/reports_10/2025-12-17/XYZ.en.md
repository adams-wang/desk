- PayPal Holdings Inc. is seeking a Utah-chartered industrial loan company to be named PayPal Bank, aiming to enhance its U.S. business-lending services and decrease its reliance on external bank partners. This move would allow PayPal to offer products like merchant credit and savings more efficiently and directly, similar to Block Inc., which secured a similar charter in 2020.
