**5. Citigroup’s Big Changes Paid Off, But The Easy Gains Are Gone (NYSE:C)**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251216T113302 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Citigroup has seen significant stock gains and narrowed its valuation gap with peers due to consistent execution, improved operating leverage, cost control, asset sales, and broad segment growth. Despite this progress, its return on tangible common equity of 8–9% still lags behind top competitors. While the immediate benefits of the turnaround are largely priced in, future upside relies on sustained profit improvement and further cost reductions, leading to a "Hold" rating.
