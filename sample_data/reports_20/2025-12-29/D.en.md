- CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP) is poised for growth due to its significant investments in infrastructure upgrades and the expansion of its renewable energy portfolio, with a long-term earnings growth rate projected at 8.86%. While rising electricity demand and grid modernization efforts are strong tailwinds, the company faces headwinds from tariffs on imported solar panels, which could increase project costs.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
