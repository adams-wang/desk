**1. A delayed clinical trial actually boosted Bristol Myers Squibb’s stock. Here’s why.**
- Source: MarketWatch | 20251203T190500 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Bristol Myers Squibb's stock rose by about 6% after the company announced a delay in the readout of a key Phase 3 clinical trial for its drug Cobenfy, intended for Alzheimer’s disease psychosis. The delay is due to the need to enroll more patients, pushing the data release to sometime next year instead of end-2025. This unexpected positive market reaction suggests investors may have factored in potential risks or are optimistic about the drug's eventual success.

- Bristol Myers Squibb announced the continuation of its ADEPT-2 Phase 3 study for psychosis associated with Alzheimer's Disease, following the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee. The company is enrolling additional patients after excluding data from a small number of sites due to execution irregularities, demonstrating its commitment to study integrity. This decision, made in consultation with the FDA, aims to identify innovative treatment options for this significant unmet medical need.

**3. BMS Delays Cobenfy Alzheimer’s Psychosis Data After ‘Irregularities’ in Phase III Study**
- Source: BioSpace | 20251203T135009 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) has delayed the readout of its Phase III ADEPT-2 trial for Cobenfy in Alzheimer's disease psychosis to 2026 due to "irregularities" at a small number of study sites, necessitating the enrollment of additional patients. This delay follows prior investor "unease" and a disappointing Phase III ARISE study for Cobenfy in schizophrenia, raising further questions about the drug's potential despite BMS's $14 billion acquisition of Karuna Therapeutics. While the delay itself might be viewed positively compared to an outright failure, analysts had previously cast doubt on Cobenfy's broader product profile.

- Bristol Myers Squibb announced the continuation of its ADEPT-2 Phase 3 study for psychosis associated with Alzheimer's Disease, following the identification of irregularities at some sites and subsequent agreement with the FDA and Data Monitoring Committee. The company will enroll additional patients to the original target study population to ensure data integrity and continue researching Cobenfy, a potential new treatment. This decision reaffirms BMS's commitment to rigorous clinical standards and addressing unmet medical needs in Alzheimer's disease.

**5. With site ‘irregularities,’ Bristol Myers delays key Cobenfy readout in Alzheimer’s psychosis**
- Source: Fierce Pharma | 20251203T101400 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Bristol Myers Squibb has delayed the readout of its key Adept-2 study for Cobenfy in Alzheimer's psychosis until late 2026 due to "irregularities" at some clinical trial sites. The company will exclude patient data from affected sites and enroll new patients, a decision seen as a positive sign by analysts as the data monitoring committee recommended continuing the trial. This setback follows other trial flops for BMS this year, intensifying pressure for the company to achieve significant wins.
