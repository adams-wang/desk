- Stifel Nicolaus has reaffirmed its "Hold" rating on The Hershey Company (NYSE: HSY), adjusting its price target multiple times from $185 to $195 and back to $185. This neutral outlook reflects concerns over elevated cocoa costs and increased tariff expenses, which are expected to impact Hershey's profitability despite strong third-quarter performance.
