- Albemarle Corporation's stock is experiencing a downturn due to market volatility, despite its critical role in lithium production for EVs.

- Source: 24/7 Wall St. | 20251229T150917 | Bullish | Relevance: 73%
- The Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT) returned 66% in 2025, significantly outperforming the Nasdaq-100's 22% gain, by focusing on the diversified battery supply chain. This performance was driven by strong growth in battery material producers like Albemarle and Freeport-McMoRan, rather than just EV manufacturers. While BATT offers high growth potential in electrification, investors should be aware of its commodity volatility, geopolitical risks due to heavy Chinese exposure, and limited liquidity.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
