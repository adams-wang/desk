- Source: TIKR.com | 20251229T130850 | Bullish | Relevance: 96%
- Monday.com (MNDY) has evolved into a sophisticated Work OS, expanding beyond project management to offer CRM, IT service, and AI solutions, serving over 250,000 customers. Despite a 26% revenue increase and record operating profit in Q3 2025, MNDY stock is down 38% for the year, indicating a market underestimation of its new reality as a profitable enterprise player. Based on a multi-product strategy, 23% annual revenue growth, and 16% operating margins, a valuation model projects the stock could reach $221 by December 2027, representing a potential 51% return from its current price.

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
