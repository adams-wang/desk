Normal yield curve (40bp spread) supports growth expectations without recession signals. 42 days to next FOMC provides policy stability window.\n\nNews themes show corporate earnings strength across sectors (BAC, SO, NEM) and active management themes, aligning with current selective market conditions. No significant forward-looking risks identified beyond current data.\n\nRegime remains NORMAL with STABLE transition, reflecting controlled volatility environment with selective participation patterns. Quality focus recommended until breadth improves above 55% threshold.",
