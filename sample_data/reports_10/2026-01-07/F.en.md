- Ford Motor Co. achieved its best annual U.S. sales since 2019, seeing a 6% increase to 2.2 million vehicles sold in 2025, driven by strong truck sales and diverse powertrain options, particularly hybrids.

The company saw a 2.7% rise in sales during the fourth quarter, despite production challenges with its F-Series pickup trucks and a notable 14.1% decline in all-electric vehicle sales.

- Ford Motor Company reported a 6% increase in sales for 2025, outperforming the industry and achieving its best annual sales and Q4 performance since 2019. The growth was significantly driven by strong demand for trucks and hybrid vehicles, with the F-Series maintaining its position as America's best-selling truck and hybrid sales reaching new records.

- Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley has announced a significant labor crisis, with 5,000 auto technician positions currently unfilled at its U.S. dealerships.

Consequences could include higher vehicle service costs for consumers due to basic supply and demand principles.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with balanced risk appetite. VIX at 15.38 sits in the normal range (18th percentile of 52-week) with modest upward drift, while yield curve remains positively sloped (+62bps 10Y-3M) supporting risk assets. Breadth at 59.5% shows healthy participation, though elevated put/call ratio (1.12) suggests some hedging activity. FOMC 20 days out provides runway for current conditions to persist.*
