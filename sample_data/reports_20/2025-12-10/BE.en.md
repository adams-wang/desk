2. Heavy insider selling: $13M sold (11 transactions in 90 days).
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 5.2x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Elevated short interest (11.1%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
