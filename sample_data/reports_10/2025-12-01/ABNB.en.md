**1. Airbnb stock price target raised to $118 by Wells Fargo on RNPL success**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251201T071300 | Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- Wells Fargo has increased its price target for Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) to $118 from $111, attributing the raise to the successful implementation of the company's Reserve Now Pay Later (RNPL) policy. The RNPL feature, launched in the U.S. in August, boosted U.S. gross booking value and is projected to add an incremental $117 million to Airbnb’s EBITDA as it expands internationally. Despite a current Underweight rating, Airbnb shows a strong balance sheet and appears undervalued based on InvestingPro's Fair Value assessment.

**2. Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Stock on November 28, 2025: Institutional Flows, Short Interest Shift and What It Means for Investors**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251129T073619 | Neutral | Relevance: 73%
- Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) was in the spotlight on November 28, 2025, due to fresh institutional filings, updated short-interest data, and ongoing reactions to a strong third-quarter performance. Despite strong Q3 2025 earnings and a new dividend, BKNG's stock has underperformed the broader market year-to-date, trading below its historical forward multiples. Institutional investors are actively rebalancing their positions, and short interest has declined, suggesting a nuanced investment picture marked by solid fundamentals but also cyclical and competitive risks.

**3. A Look at Booking Holdings (BKNG) Valuation Following Strong Q3 Earnings, Upbeat Guidance, and Wedbush Upgrade**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251129T004346 | Neutral | Relevance: 64%
- Booking Holdings (BKNG) reported strong Q3 earnings, exceeding expectations and raising its full-year guidance, driven by its Connected Trip strategy, loyalty programs, and AI features. Market analysts see the company as potentially undervalued, with a fair value estimate of $6,207 per share compared to its current price of $4,914.69, despite a P/E ratio higher than industry averages. The company's growth outlook is supported by its focus on alternative accommodations, loyalty programs, and strategic AI partnerships, though competition and shifting travel behaviors present risks.
