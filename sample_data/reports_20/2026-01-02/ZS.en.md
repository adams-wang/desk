The stock is showing strong support at the $225 area and is within a historically bullish long-term trend, suggesting potential double-digit gains.

- Mizuho upgraded Zscaler Inc. (NASDAQ: ZS) to Outperform on December 16, citing valuation support despite concerns about near-term growth and pressure on gross margins from rapid adoption of newer, lower-margin products. Analyst Gregg Moskowitz highlighted that recent share weakness, attributed to F2Q net new ARR guidance and lack of specific contribution from the Red Canary acquisition, makes the stock an attractive buy given its strong positioning in SASE/Zero Trust. The company is a cloud-based security provider that offers cybersecurity solutions by protecting user access to applications and data regardless of location.
