**1. There's No Escaping Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:SRPT) Muted Revenues Despite A 35% Share Price Rise**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251205T045322 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
-  Sarepta Therapeutics' stock saw a 35% gain recently but still suffers from an 83% drop over the last year. Despite a low price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.9x compared to the industry average, the company's revenue forecast projects a 16% annual slump for the next three years, contrasting sharply with the industry's expected 126% growth. This muted revenue outlook explains the low P/S ratio and suggests potential for further stock price stagnation unless top-line growth improves substantially.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with stabilizing volatility and moderate risk appetite. Fed in data-dependent mode with 7 days to FOMC—soft economic data (retail -4.67% MoM, CPI 2.89% rising) offsetting labor resilience. AI infrastructure demand and capital reallocation themes dominating corporate narratives, signaling selective risk-on in growth/tech segments. Narrow breadth (52% above 50MA) and neutral put/call suggest complacency but not excess—standard late-cycle positioning amid policy uncertainty.*
