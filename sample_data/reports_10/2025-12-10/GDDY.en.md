-  Lumen CTO Dave Ward explains that the current internet infrastructure is insufficient for AI workloads and evolving enterprise cloud demands, driving the emergence of "Cloud 2.0." This new era requires a fundamental network architecture shift, with data processing closer to the edge and redesigned enterprise networks moving away from hub-and-spoke designs to direct point-to-point connectivity. CIOs must adapt their WAN and cloud infrastructure to support these changes and leverage consumption-based economics for greater flexibility.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
