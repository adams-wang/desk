### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -9.6% to -14.2% (-4.6% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 18.2pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -12.8% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 13.0pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.68x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 44. Volume at 55% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
