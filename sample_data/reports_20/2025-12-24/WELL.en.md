- Source: 24/7 Wall St. | 20251222T135731 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 71%
- The Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH) is poised for an inflection point in 2026 as Federal Reserve rate cuts are anticipated to drive lower long-term Treasury yields, making REIT dividends more attractive and reducing discount rates for property valuations. With a significant $162 billion in commercial real estate loans maturing in 2026, the success of SCHH's holdings hinges on a favorable refinancing environment spurred by falling rates. The ETF's performance will also depend on the momentum of its various subsectors, including healthcare and industrial REITs, and the 10-year Treasury yield's movement below 4%.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | AVOID (Zone C) | 0.50x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
