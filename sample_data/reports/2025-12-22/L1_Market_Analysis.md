**Conflicts & Divergences**
- VIX at 52-week lows suggests complacency, but put/call ratio at 1.139 shows underlying hedging demand
- Breadth improving to 57.7% but still moderate, inconsistent with extremely low VIX readings
- Strong individual earnings stories but lack of broad market enthusiasm suggests rotation rather than risk-on

**Positioning Guidance**
- Regime: NORMAL (IMPROVING)
- Confidence: MEDIUM
- Position size: 120% max
- Key action: Maintain selective positioning in quality growth names, particularly AI beneficiaries, while monitoring for complacency signs given extreme VIX lows.

**Triggers**
- Upgrade: Breadth expansion above 65% confirming broad participation, Sustained earnings beats across multiple sectors, Fed dovish pivot signals ahead of January meeting
- Downgrade: VIX spike above 18 breaking complacency, Breadth deterioration below 45% signaling rotation failure, Economic data disappointment challenging soft landing narrative

**Risk Factors**
- Extreme VIX lows creating complacency risk
- Narrow market leadership vulnerable to rotation
- Holiday thin liquidity amplifying moves
- January FOMC meeting uncertainty
