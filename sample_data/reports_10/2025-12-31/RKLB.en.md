This comes amidst conflicting signals including a major $816 million defense contract for 18 satellites, and insider selling activity combined with ongoing profitability concerns. Analysts have raised price targets due to the defense contract, but investors are advised to monitor the Neutron rocket development and satellite production schedule for sustained cash flow.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
