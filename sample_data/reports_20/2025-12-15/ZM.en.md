### Catalysts

- Analyst target momentum: 4 raises (avg +7%) could attract flows.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

Analyst sentiment positive (4 raises, avg +7%). Insider selling cluster ($9.3M in 90 days), potential headwind. Institutional flow bullish (6 buying vs 3 selling).
