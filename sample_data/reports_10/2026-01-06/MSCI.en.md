- Strategy Inc (MSTR) shares jumped after hours after MSCI announced it would not exclude companies holding significant digital assets from its global stock indexes.

- MSCI has decided, for now, not to exclude digital asset treasury companies (DATCOs) from its market index, which led to a 5.7% rise in Michael Saylor’s Strategy shares. While inclusion continues for now, MSCI plans broader consultations to differentiate between investment companies and operational companies holding digital assets. This decision ensures DATCOs remain eligible for passive index funds, preserving demand and liquidity for digital assets.

- MSCI has decided against excluding digital asset treasury companies (DATCOs), such as Michael Saylor's Strategy, from its global indexes. This decision reverses fears of potential classification as investment funds, which would have led to their removal and significant market outflows. MSCI plans further consultation on non-operating companies but will keep DATCOs included under existing rules for now, alleviating uncertainty in the digital asset market.

- Shares of Michael Saylor-led MicroStrategy (MSTR) surged 6% in after-hours trading following MSCI's decision not to exclude digital asset treasury companies (DATs) from its indexes. MSCI stated that further research is needed to distinguish between investment companies and those holding digital assets as part of core operations. This resolve removes a significant overhang for DATs, potentially boosting capital inflow into the sector and causing Bitcoin to also see a modest gain.

However, MSCI plans to conduct a broader consultation on the treatment of non-operating companies in general.
