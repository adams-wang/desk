### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -9.9% to -6.8% (+3.1% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 10.8pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -5.9% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 5.7pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.12x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 43. Volume at 48% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.
