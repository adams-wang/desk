- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods has raised its price target for Travelers Companies (TRV) to $240 from $226, maintaining an "Outperform" rating. This adjustment follows Travelers' announcement that it will divest its Canadian operations to Intact Financial for approximately $400 million, a move expected to streamline its business and improve capital efficiency. Despite the divestiture, analysts anticipate a significant earnings per share (EPS) contribution from Travelers' U.S. operations in 2024.

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
