### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.54) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_10 falling (-2.4% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 142.9x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Elevated short interest (8.3%): bears positioning against stock.
5. Near-term weakness: 10.7% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
