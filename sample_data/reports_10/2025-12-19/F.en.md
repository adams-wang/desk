- William Clay Ford Jr., Executive Chair of Ford Motor Co., has been named the worst CEO of the year for 2025 due to Ford's disastrous entry into the electric vehicle business. His long-standing involvement in the company and his personal investment in the EV strategy, particularly with the F-150 Lightning, led to a $19.5 billion write-off for the company as it scaled back its EV ambitions. Despite Jim Farley being the CEO, the article attributes the major strategic missteps to Bill Ford's influence and long tenure.

The layoffs, affecting 1,600 employees, resulted from Ford's shift away from its Lightning F-150 electric pickup trucks to focus on other battery applications. Many employees, some of whom moved to Hardin County specifically for these jobs, now face significant financial uncertainty, with some criticizing Ford's handling of the communication.
