Ultimately, Warner shareholders will decide which offer to accept, with Morningstar maintaining its preference for the Paramount bid due to its certainty of cash and potentially fewer regulatory hurdles.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
