- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251217T141008 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- SoFi Technologies' stock experienced a shaky chart after failing to hold above $30, but fundamentals suggest accelerating earnings and a higher 2026 repricing despite recent equity dilution. The company's Loan Platform Business is driving higher-margin, less rate-sensitive income, enhancing earnings power and reducing reliance on traditional lending. Strategic capital raises, including $3.2 billion in equity to reduce high-cost debt, are viewed as moves to optimize the balance sheet and fuel technology expansion, leading to a 12-month target price of $36.87 with a 43% upside.
