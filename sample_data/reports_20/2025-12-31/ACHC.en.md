### Position Sizing

- **Shares:** 1028
- **Position Value:** $14,587.32
- **Portfolio %:** 14.59%
- **Risk Dollars:** $1,440.00
- **Risk Per Trade:** 1.44%
- **Modifiers:** L1 120% | L2 120% | Combined 1.44x

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
