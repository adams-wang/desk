  "full_analysis": "MARKET REGIME ASSESSMENT:\n\nCurrent conditions reflect a NORMAL market regime with STABLE transition characteristics. The VIX at 15.74 sits comfortably in the normal range (15-22), showing only modest elevation from recent lows as we approach the Fed decision. The 6% daily increase reflects natural pre-FOMC positioning rather than systemic stress.\n\nKEY OBSERVATIONS:\n\n1. VOLATILITY STRUCTURE: VIX at 20th percentile of 52-week range indicates calm conditions, with the recent uptick to 15.74 from 14.85 representing healthy caution before the Fed meeting rather than fear.\n\n2. YIELD CURVE HEALTH: 10Y-3M spread at 67bps maintains normal positive slope, indicating no recession fears. The curve shape supports continued growth expectations without stress signals.\n\n3. BREADTH DYNAMICS: At 53.9%, breadth shows modest participation - not strong enough for RISK_ON but above the 40% weakness threshold. This suggests selective positioning rather than broad-based conviction.\n\n4. SENTIMENT INDICATORS: Put/Call ratio at 0.852 is below the 0.9 neutral threshold, indicating potential complacency. This creates a subtle contrarian warning but not enough to shift regime assessment.\n\nCONFLICTS AND DIVERGENCES:\n\nThe most notable conflict is between calm volatility metrics and narrow market participation. VIX remains subdued while breadth shows only modest engagement, suggesting investors are positioned but not with broad conviction. The extremely low Put/Call ratio versus elevated sector-specific volatility (cannabis up 40%, tech/AI weakness) indicates rotation rather than direction.\n\nNEWS CONTEXT:\n\nNews themes are predominantly sector-specific rather than macro-systemic. Cannabis regulatory optimism, AI profitability concerns, and financial sector strength represent rotation opportunities rather than broad regime shifts. No significant geopolitical or monetary policy surprises beyond the scheduled Fed meeting.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING ASSESSMENT:\n\nWith FOMC 4 days away, current positioning appears appropriate for the uncertainty level. The stable macro backdrop (controlled inflation, steady employment, falling rates) supports the NORMAL regime classification. Key trigger would be Fed surprise in either direction, but current data doesn't suggest dramatic policy shifts.\n\nRISK ADJUSTMENT RATIONALE:\n\nNo adjustment warranted as news themes align with current market pricing. VIX level appropriately reflects pre-FOMC uncertainty, and sector-specific news doesn't introduce systemic risk not already captured in volatility metrics.",
