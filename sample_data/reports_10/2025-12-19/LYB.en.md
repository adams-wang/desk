**1. Wells Fargo cuts chemicals ratings, says downturn likely to extend into 2026**
- Source: Investing.com | 20251219T190839 | Bearish | Relevance: 74%
- Wells Fargo has downgraded several major U.S. chemical companies, including Air Products, Celanese, Eastman Chemical, and LyondellBasell, citing weak demand and limited visibility that is expected to prolong the sector's downturn into at least the first half of 2026. The bank's industry checks indicate continued pressure from soft demand, customer destocking, and margin compression, with few signs of improvement for the coming year. Despite a cautious outlook for much of the sector, Wells Fargo recommends high-quality names like Linde, DuPont, and International Flavors & Fragrances, and maintains a positive stance on paint makers due to more resilient earnings.
