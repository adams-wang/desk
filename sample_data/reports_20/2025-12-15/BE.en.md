### Key Risks

2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_20 falling (-13.2% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Heavy insider selling: $12M sold (9 transactions in 90 days).
4. Valuation stretched: PEG 5.0x requires aggressive growth execution.
5. Elevated short interest (11.1%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
