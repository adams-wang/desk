Investors are now weighing the positive fundamental impact of the PJM auction against ongoing market sentiment risks and upcoming CPI data.

- Vistra Corp. (VST) is positioned to benefit from a declining interest rate environment due to its diversified power generation portfolio and capital-intensive operations. Lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs and support economic growth, which in turn boosts power demand. This financial easing will enable Vistra to fund its significant capital expenditure plans focused on zero-carbon nuclear output, solar, battery storage, and optimizing its natural gas fleet.
