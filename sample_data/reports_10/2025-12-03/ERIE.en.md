-  Banco Santander has completed the sale of 3,576,626 shares of Santander Bank Polska, representing 3.5% of its capital, at PLN 482.0 per share. This transaction, combined with a previously announced sale of 49% to Erste Group Bank AG, will leave Banco Santander with approximately a 9.7% stake in the Polish bank. The move is intended for proactive capital optimization, though Santander will maintain a presence in the Polish market through Santander Consumer and a strategic collaboration with Erste.

### Market Context

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
