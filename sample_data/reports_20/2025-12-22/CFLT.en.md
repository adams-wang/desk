### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 20.2% to 12.0% (-8.3% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Extended beyond STRENGTH zone (12.0% > 10.0%), caution on chasing. MRS_5 (-1.4%) diverging from MRS_20 - short-term weakness emerging. AM_20 at 12.6% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 11.8pp, stock-specific strength. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). RSI overbought at 77, risk of mean reversion. Volume at 59% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -SUL (Resistance).
