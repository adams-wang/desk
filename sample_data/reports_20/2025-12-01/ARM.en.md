### Key Risks

1. High beta (4.25) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Premium valuation (P/E 60x, PEG 2.8x) vulnerable to multiple compression.
3. Elevated short interest (9.6%): bears positioning against stock.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
