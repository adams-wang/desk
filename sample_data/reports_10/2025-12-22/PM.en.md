The author highlights the rapid growth of PM's smoke-free business (IQOS, ZYN, VEEV), its margin-accretive nature, and strategic investments in Zyn supply as key reasons for optimism. Despite a premium valuation on simple metrics, the author suggests PM deserves it due to its growth profile and superior margins, recommending it as a core long-term buy.
