- Rigetti Computing (RGTI) is experiencing significant Wall Street attention, with analysts issuing varied price targets ranging from $30 to $50, reflecting the high uncertainty and potential of quantum computing. The company is advancing its technical roadmap with ambitious qubit targets and maintains strong liquidity with approximately $600 million in cash and investments. Despite a small current revenue base and profitability challenges, Rigetti shows early commercial traction and leverages ecosystem catalysts like NVIDIA NVQLink to position itself for future growth in the hybrid quantum-AI computing space.

**2. Better Quantum Computing Stock for 2026: IonQ or Rigetti Computing?**
- Source: The Motley Fool | 20251220T120929 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- IonQ and Rigetti Computing are two pure-play quantum computing stocks facing significant volatility and market risk aversion. IonQ employs a trapped-ion qubit approach, offering high accuracy, while Rigetti uses superconducting qubits. Despite IonQ's technological edge and selection for the DARPA Quantum Benchmarking Initiative's Stage B, both companies' future success in 2026 largely depends on market sentiment rather than their current technological advancements, as commercially viable quantum computing is still years away.
