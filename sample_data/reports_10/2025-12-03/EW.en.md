- Cooper Companies (COO) is set to release its Q4 fiscal 2025 earnings on December 14, with expectations of increased revenues and earnings per share driven by strong performance in its CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI) segments. The CVI segment is anticipated to benefit from MyDAY lens demand despite Clariti weakness, while the CSI segment may experience softness due to conservative cash management by fertility clinics and declining PARAGARD sales. The Zacks Model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for COO, given its -1.05% Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
