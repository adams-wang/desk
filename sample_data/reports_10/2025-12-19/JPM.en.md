- Source: StreetInsider | 20251218T190947 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC has issued $350,000 Review Notes linked to the S&P 500® Equal Weight Index, the Russell 2000® Index, and the State Street® Energy Select Sector SPDR® ETF, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. acting as guarantor. These structured investments are designed for investors seeking an early exit at a premium if specific market conditions are met, but they carry significant risks including potential loss of principal and credit risks of both the issuer and guarantor. The notes do not pay interest, and investors are exposed to the performance of the least performing of the three underlying assets.
