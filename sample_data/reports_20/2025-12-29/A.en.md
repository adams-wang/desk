**1. Paradiem LLC Makes New Investment in Keysight Technologies Inc. $KEYS**
- Source: MarketBeat | 20251228T122922 | Neutral | Relevance: 64%
- Paradiem LLC has acquired a new stake of 5,597 shares, valued at approximately $979,000, in Keysight Technologies Inc. during the third quarter. The company has recently authorized a $1.50 billion share buyback program and exceeded EPS estimates for the last quarter. Despite significant insider selling totaling over $15 million, institutional investors, including Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp, have largely increased their holdings.

**2. Standard BioTools: Outlook Still Murky (NASDAQ:LAB)**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251228T140919 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
- Standard BioTools is currently trading near its cash value following the sale of SomaScan, with Casdin Capital increasing its stake to 25%. While the company will receive $350M upfront and potential earnouts from Illumina for SomaScan, leading to $550M in cash post-transaction, its ongoing operations lack clear growth catalysts. This situation, combined with projected Adj. EBITDA breakeven in 2026 after divestiture and a 20% workforce reduction, indicates a murky outlook despite a recent rally in share price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -5.0% to -3.0% (+2.0% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 7.0pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). Underperforming sector by 4.0pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.10x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). Volume at 38% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -SUL (Resistance).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
