- Newmont Corporation (NEM) has seen its stock rally over 110% year-to-date in 2025, driven by record gold prices, cost-cutting, and a buyback program. Despite this significant run, institutional investors continued to flood into the stock on November 29, 2025, while some analysts began to express caution about the sustainability of the "gold rush" and potential "visibility risks" related to gold price volatility. The company's Q3 2025 performance, including record free cash flow and a fatter dividend, underpins the bullish sentiment, but gold price dependency and integration risks remain key concerns.
