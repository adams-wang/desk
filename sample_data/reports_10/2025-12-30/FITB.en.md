- Activist investors are increasingly targeting U.S. banks, with a focus on pushing for significant changes like mergers and acquisitions. This aggressive stance is exemplified by HoldCo Asset Management's campaign against Comerica's proposed sale to Fifth Third Bancorp, arguing the deal undervalues Comerica and sparking an "all-out war" between the firm and the bank. The trend suggests a brewing period of disruption for the banking sector, possibly fueled by deregulation efforts.

- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251229T190815 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 74%
- M&T Bank (MTB) has seen consistent net interest income (NII) growth, with falling interest rates expected to further boost NII by stabilizing funding costs and increasing lending activity. Management anticipates NII (tax-equivalent) to be between $7.05–$7.15 billion in 2025 and projects modest easing of rates in 2026, supporting continued NII expansion through balance sheet growth. Peers like Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) also expect NII growth driven by similar market conditions.
