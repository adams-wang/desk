**1. Hasbro 'Power Rangers' Purchase Took Toy Rights Back From Bandai Namco, Leading To Death Of 'Super Sentai'**
- Source: Bounding Into Comics | 20251201T072300 | Neutral | Relevance: 98%
- Hasbro's acquisition of the Power Rangers toy rights from Bandai Namco is identified as a major factor in the decline of Super Sentai, according to reporter Kiyofumi Tane. The article explains that while slumping sales due to Japan's birth rate decline and the rise of free-to-play smartphone games were contributors, the loss of significant revenue from Power Rangers toy sales profoundly impacted Super Sentai's financial viability. This move by Hasbro, after re-acquiring Power Rangers from Haim Saban, ultimately led to the "lone loser" situation for Super Sentai in comparison to other successful tokusatsu franchises like Kamen Rider and Ultraman.
