  "cycle_reasoning": "Early expansion identification based on cyclical leadership emergence (Materials and Energy ignition), Technology maintaining trend leadership, and broad defensive sector weakness. The pattern of 2 ignition signals in beaten-down cyclicals plus 1 sustained trend in growth sectors while 4 defensive/rate-sensitive sectors underperform creates the classic early expansion signature with high confidence.",
  "rotation_analysis": "The market is exhibiting classic early expansion characteristics with cyclical sectors breaking out of underperformance zones. Materials (XLB) and Energy (XLE) are both showing IGNITION signals from Zone D, indicating capital flow into beaten-down cyclicals as risk appetite improves. Technology (XLK) maintains its leadership position in Zone A with sustained uptrend momentum, benefiting from both AI themes and rate sensitivity. The middle tier shows neutral positioning across Industrials, Consumer Cyclical, Financials, and Communication Services, suggesting selective stock-picking environments in these sectors. The defensive complex is experiencing broad-based outflows, with Utilities in toxic territory (-5.51% MRS_20) and Healthcare, Real Estate, and Consumer Staples all in avoid status. This rotation pattern strongly supports the early expansion cycle classification.",
  "l1_alignment": "Perfect alignment between L1 NORMAL regime with improving risk appetite and L2 sector rotation. The AGGRESSIVE position bias from L1 supports the cyclical breakouts we're seeing in XLB and XLE, while XLK's continued leadership aligns with the improving sentiment. Defensive sector weakness (XLU, XLV, XLRE, XLP) confirms the rotation away from safety trades that characterizes the transition from defensive to risk-on positioning.",
  "key_insight": "The market is transitioning from defensive positioning to early cycle risk-taking, with cyclical sectors (Materials, Energy) breaking out of underperformance zones just as banks proactively cut prime rates ahead of FOMC - creating a powerful setup for continued cyclical leadership if the dovish pivot materializes.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (HIGH confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 shows NORMAL regime with improving risk appetite and AGGRESSIVE bias. Sector rotation aligns well - cyclical sectors (XLB, XLE) showing IGNITION signals while defensive sectors (XLU, XLV, XLRE, XLP) are weak. Tech leadership (XLK TREND) supports risk-on environment.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll signals validate against thresholds. Zone D IGNITION signals (XLB, XLE) show MRS_5>0 as required. Zone A TREND (XLK) maintains positive momentum. Zone C TOXIC (XLU) at -5.51% confirms deep underperformance. No anomalies detected.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: D (4 sectors - mixed signals), A (1 sector - bullish), E (4 sectors - neutral), C (1 sector - bearish). Rotation direction is RISK-ON with cyclicals igniting and defensives underperforming. Materials and Energy leading breakout.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo L1 vs L2 conflict - both indicate improving risk appetite. Bank prime rate cuts ahead of FOMC support dovish narrative. Sector rotation from defensives to cyclicals aligns with NORMAL regime improving to risk-on positioning.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nEarly expansion identification based on cyclical leadership emergence (Materials and Energy ignition), Technology maintaining trend leadership, and broad defensive sector weakness. The pattern of 2 ignition signals in beaten-down cyclicals plus 1 sustained trend in growth sectors while 4 defensive/rate-sensitive sectors underperform creates the classic early expansion signature with high confidence.\n\nKey Insight: The market is transitioning from defensive positioning to early cycle risk-taking, with cyclical sectors (Materials, Energy) breaking out of underperformance zones just as banks proactively cut prime rates ahead of FOMC - creating a powerful setup for continued cyclical leadership if the dovish pivot materializes."
