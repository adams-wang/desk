This move signals a belief that the market has mispriced Chemours following accounting scandals, dividend cuts, and environmental litigation, particularly after a landmark PFAS settlement provided a clearer financial outlook for the company. The investment by Alta suggests a potential turning point for Chemours and could serve as a bellwether for how the financial markets price the risks associated with "forever chemical" litigation.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite supported by year-end positioning. VIX at cycle lows (13.47) and multiple sectors hitting 52-week highs indicate constructive sentiment, though breadth at 57.9% suggests selectivity remains important. Fed pause expectations and stable macro backdrop support risk assets.*
