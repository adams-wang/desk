*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite persisting. Mixed earnings signals with industrial weakness (John Deere) offset by consumer/tech strength, while institutional flows show selective positioning rather than broad risk-off. Fed meeting in 9 days provides near-term catalyst but current data suggests status quo maintenance.*
