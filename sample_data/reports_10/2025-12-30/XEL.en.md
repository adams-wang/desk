- Xcel Energy's natural gas customers in Minnesota face a 6.8% rate increase starting January 1st, adding about $70 annually to the average home's bill. This temporary hike was approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) while they review Xcel's larger request for an 8.2% increase. The utility attributes the need for higher rates to maintenance costs for safety, infrastructure upgrades, and increased operating expenses.
