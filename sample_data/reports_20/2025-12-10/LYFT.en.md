3. Insider selling cluster: $3.6M in recent transactions.
4. High short interest (16.7%, 3.6 days to cover): squeeze risk or crowded bearish bet.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
