**1. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): Is the 40% Year-to-Date Rally Just Catch-Up to Fair Value?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251209T011512 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 99%
- Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has seen significant momentum, with its stock up 14% in 3 months and nearly 40% year-to-date, prompting questions about its valuation. While the stock trades just below analyst targets, it still shows a substantial intrinsic value gap, suggesting it may be undervalued.

- Source: BioPharma Dive | 20251209T130817 | Bullish | Relevance: 99%
-  New data from Johnson & Johnson's MajesTEC-3 trial suggest that a Tecvayli-based combination therapy could offer a curative potential when used early in the treatment of multiple myeloma. The combination of Tecvayli with Darzalex significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 83% and led to an 82% complete response rate, compared to standard treatments. This positive outcome points to a future where bispecific antibodies like Tecvayli could be moved to earlier lines of care, offering a more accessible alternative to CAR-T therapies, though vigilance regarding infection risks remains crucial.
