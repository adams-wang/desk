- Fat Brands is facing significant financial distress, evidenced by a trustee demanding full payment on nearly $1.3 billion in debt and the company's inability to make a quarterly payment. The company, which owns Fazoli’s, Fatburger, and other chains, has demonstrated a pattern of financial challenges, including missed vendor payments, weakening sales, declining profits, and controversies surrounding its financing methods. These issues could potentially lead to bankruptcy for the Beverly Hills-based company, as its shares and those of its spun-off entity, Twin Peaks, have plummeted.
