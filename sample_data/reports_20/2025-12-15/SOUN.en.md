- SoundHound AI, Inc. (SOUN) has seen an 8.12% stock price decline despite positive analyst upgrades, including a raised price target of $15 from Mizuho Securities and Cantor Fitzgerald. The company reported increased revenue but also a significant GAAP net loss, coupled with negative insider sentiment due to increased selling. The stock's performance is further impacted by broader market volatility in the AI sector, even as SoundHound pursues strategic partnerships like its integration with OpenTable for conversational in-vehicle voice AI.
