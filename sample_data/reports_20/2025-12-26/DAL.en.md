### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from 5.8% to 1.9% (-3.9% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 2.1pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 (-0.7%) diverging from MRS_20 - short-term weakness emerging. Full SMA alignment bullish (above 20/50/200 SMAs). Volume at 43% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -DBL (Indecision).
