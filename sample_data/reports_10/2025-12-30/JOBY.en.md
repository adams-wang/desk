### Key Risks

1. High beta (2.54) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Momentum deterioration: MRS_10 falling (-3.2% 5d) with bearish MACD, trend may be turning.
3. Valuation stretched: PEG 142.9x requires aggressive growth execution.
4. Elevated short interest (8.3%): bears positioning against stock.
5. Near-term weakness: 11.0% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.
