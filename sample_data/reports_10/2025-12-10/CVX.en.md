- Chevron Corp. is currently in talks with the Trump administration regarding its Venezuelan operations, with CEO Mike Wirth asserting that the company's continued presence benefits U.S. interests.

-  An international arbitration panel has ordered Ecuador to pay Chevron $220 million, marking a new development in the decades-long legal battle over Texaco's (now Chevron's) toxic pollution in the Amazon. This award compensates Chevron for legal fees incurred defending against a class-action lawsuit, despite the Ecuadorian courts previously ruling against the oil company in a $9.5 billion judgment. Critics argue this outcome highlights flaws in the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) system, which allows foreign companies to bypass national courts and potentially avoid accountability for environmental damages.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
