- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20260106T100801 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%

Despite recent respectable historical earnings growth, analysts expect future EPS growth to underperform the market. This suggests investors might be overly optimistic about a turnaround, potentially setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E ratio adjusts to align with the more modest growth outlook.
