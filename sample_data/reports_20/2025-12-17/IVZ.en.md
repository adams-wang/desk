**5. Why a revenue-weighted strategy may make sense now**
- Source: Invesco | 20251217T190923 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 96%
- As market leadership becomes concentrated and valuations potentially overstretched, a revenue-weighted ETF strategy like the Invesco S&P 500 Revenue ETF (RWL) offers a potential solution for investors. RWL diversifies holdings by weighting based on proportional revenue contribution rather than market capitalization, providing exposure to a broad market with lower valuations and less concentration. This approach may be particularly relevant as a broadening economic backdrop creates opportunities beyond mega-cap companies.
