**1. NuScale Power (SMR) Stock Forecast: December 2025 Rally Tests Nuclear‑AI Hype Against Dilution Risk**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251204T160908 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- NuScale Power (SMR) has seen a sharp rebound in December 2025 following a November sell-off, driven by renewed interest in nuclear power for AI data centers and new U.S. Department of Energy funding. The company faces a critical shareholder vote on December 16, 2025, to approve an increase in authorized shares, which is vital for its continued funding but also introduces significant dilution risk. Analysts are deeply divided on NuScale's future, reflecting the tension between its potential as a first-mover in small modular reactors and its pre-revenue, highly unprofitable profile.
