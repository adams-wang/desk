The company offers a strong yield of approximately 4.4%, which is a decade high, and its resilient business model suggests potential for 8% annual returns.

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from 1.5% to 3.1% (+1.6% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 0.9pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis).

MACD histogram positive (0.54), confirming momentum. Volume at 50% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +FTL (Rally).

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
