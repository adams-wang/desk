-  Veralto Corp (VLTO) has underperformed the S&P 500, posting a small loss since June 2025. The article highlights two main concerns: sluggish long-term revenue growth (4.4% CAGR over four years) and slim projected revenue growth (5.4% over the next 12 months), suggesting the company's new products aren't yet catalyzing top-line performance. Despite a reasonable valuation, the "shakier fundamentals" present too much downside risk, leading the author to recommend alternative industrial stocks with stronger growth prospects.
