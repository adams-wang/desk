**2. H.C. Wainwright: BioMarin's (BMRN) Amicus Acquisition Stabilizes Cash Flow While Voxzogo Remains Near-Term Driver**
- Source: Finviz | 20260101T110951 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 96%
- H.C. Wainwright raised its price target for BioMarin (BMRN) to $60 from $55, maintaining a Neutral rating, following BioMarin's acquisition of Amicus Therapeutics Inc. for $4.8 billion. While the acquisition of Amicus aims to stabilize long-term cash flows, Voxzogo is expected to be the primary driver of BioMarin's stock value in the near term, as peak sales from the Amicus acquisition are not anticipated until the 2030s. The acquisition broadens BioMarin's rare disease portfolio with key therapies like Galafold and Pombiliti + Opfolda, which generated $599 million in combined revenue over the past four quarters.
