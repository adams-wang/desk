- A new savings program, dubbed "Trump accounts," designed to help American children build wealth, has received significant funding boosts from billionaires Michael and Susan Dell, Ray Dalio, and BlackRock Inc. These accounts, established under a tax and spending bill, are structured to function similarly to individual retirement accounts upon a child turning 18, with specific rules regarding contributions, investments, and withdrawals. While offering a long-term savings option, they have fewer tax advantages compared to 529 plans and have drawn skepticism from critics regarding their effectiveness in addressing wealth inequality.
