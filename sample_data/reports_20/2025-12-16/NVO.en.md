- Novo Nordisk's stock saw a rebound after a challenging year, driven by the EU regulator's support for a higher-dose Wegovy, the launch of Ozempic in India at a competitive price, and the acquisition of Akero Therapeutics to expand into MASH. Despite a general market concern about increased competition and patent expirations, these developments highlight Novo's strategic moves to defend market share and diversify its portfolio. The week ahead will focus on FDA timelines for Wegovy's oral and higher-dose formulations, ongoing competitive developments, and macro market factors.

- Source: NDTV | 20251214T060848 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Novo Nordisk has launched Ozempic (semaglutide) in India, primarily for type 2 diabetes treatment, despite its global reputation for weight loss. Vikrant Shrotriya, MD of Novo Nordisk India, emphasized the drug's role in improving blood sugar control and supporting weight management for diabetes patients, not as a "miracle fix" or for cosmetic use. The company is focused on responsible medical use, addressing misinformation, and ensuring accessibility through tailored pricing for the Indian market.
