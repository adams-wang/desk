**1. Morgan Stanley Downgrades MGM China Stock Rating While MGM International Posts Gains**
- Source: Eudaimonia and Co | 20251229T131036 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 69%
- Morgan Stanley downgraded MGM China's stock rating from Overweight to Equal-weight due to anticipated higher royalty payments to its parent company, MGM Resorts International, which are expected to decrease future earnings. Despite MGM China's stock experiencing a significant single-day slump following news of the new branding agreement, MGM Resorts International posted gains. The royalty payments will increase significantly, impacting MGM China's profit margins, while MGM Resorts International benefits from the branding agreement and shows positive year-to-date performance.

**2. Swedbank AB Boosts Stock Position in Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. $GLPI**
- Source: MarketBeat | 20251228T111027 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- Swedbank AB significantly increased its stake in Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (GLPI) by 133% in Q3, now holding 63,265 shares valued at $2.95 million. Other institutional investors like Balyasny Asset Management and Thrivent Financial for Lutherans also increased their positions, pushing institutional ownership to 91.14%. The company reported Q3 EPS of $0.97, beating estimates, and announced a quarterly dividend of $0.78, resulting in a 7.0% yield, though with a payout ratio above current earnings.

**3. MGM Resorts and MGM China extend branding agreement**
- Source: ReadWrite | 20251229T112040 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 61%
- MGM Resorts International has signed a new long-term branding deal with MGM China Holdings, extending their partnership as MGM China continues to show strong financial performance, especially in Macau. The agreement, effective January 1, 2026, will run until Macau’s current gaming concession ends in 2032 and automatically extend further if new concessions are granted. Under the updated terms, MGM China will pay a higher monthly license fee, increasing to 3.5% of its adjusted consolidated net monthly revenue, with MGM Resorts receiving two-thirds of this fee.

**4. MGM Resorts Extends Casino Branding Deal in China’s Macau Through License Term**
- Source: Casino.org | 20251229T163556 | Neutral | Relevance: 60%
- MGM Resorts International has extended its branding agreement with MGM China through 2032, coinciding with MGM China's gaming concession term in Macau. The new terms significantly increase the monthly licensing fee paid by MGM China to MGM Resorts from 1.75% to 3.5% of its adjusted consolidated net revenue, which analysts believe will negatively impact MGM China's near-term EBITDA. This extension aims to secure MGM China's brand usage and reflects the increased market share MGM China has achieved in Macau's gaming industry.

RSI neutral at 43. Volume at 52% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -MLL (Support test).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
