**Conflicts & Divergences**
- VIX complacency (8th percentile) vs put/call ratio elevated at 1.047 suggests smart money hedging
- Decent breadth (57.6%) vs mixed earnings narratives indicates selective strength masking underlying caution
- Falling Fed funds vs rising CPI creates policy uncertainty ahead of December 17 FOMC meeting

**Positioning Guidance**
- Regime: NORMAL (STABLE)
- Confidence: MEDIUM
- Position size: 115% max
- Key action: Maintain selective positioning with modest caution ahead of Fed decision, avoiding complacency despite calm VIX.

**Triggers**
- Upgrade: VIX breaks below 13.5 (52-week low) with breadth >65% confirming risk-on momentum, Fed delivers dovish surprise at December 17 meeting with clear forward guidance, Breadth expansion above 65% with small-cap outperformance confirming broad participation
- Downgrade: VIX spikes above 20 on policy uncertainty or earnings disappointments, Breadth deteriorates below 45% indicating narrow market leadership, Put/call ratio exceeds 1.3 suggesting fear escalation, Fed delivers hawkish surprise or guidance uncertainty

**Risk Factors**
- Fed policy uncertainty with meeting in 5 days amid conflicting inflation/employment data
- Trade policy headwinds affecting multinational corporations (ADM guidance cut example)
- VIX complacency at 8th percentile may not reflect building policy risks
- Mixed earnings season with corporate margin pressure from wage inflation
