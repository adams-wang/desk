**3. Oshkosh (OSK): Revisiting Valuation After a Strong Year of Share Price and Earnings Growth**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251225T160928 | Neutral | Relevance: 62%
- Oshkosh (OSK) has experienced significant share price and earnings growth over the past year, leading to a re-evaluation of its valuation. Despite the strong performance, the stock is currently assessed as undervalued with a fair value of $153.08, compared to its last closing price of $130.43, due to factors like accelerating innovation in electric vehicles and multi-year government contract wins. However, potential risks such as tariff pressure and heavy reliance on government contracts could impact future earnings.

**4. China Yuchai’s Stock Tripled On Emissions Rules And Buybacks**
- Source: Finimize | 20251227T070932 | Neutral | Relevance: 61%
- China Yuchai International Limited (NYSE: CYD) saw its stock price nearly triple over the past year, driven by increased demand for heavy-duty engines due to China's infrastructure spending, upcoming stricter emissions standards, and share buybacks. Despite significant growth (revenue up 6% and net profit up 13.2% in FY 2024), the company faces risks from thin operating margins, cyclical market exposure, and geopolitical factors. Its valuation appears reasonable compared to peers, but long-term investment depends on its ability to improve margins and diversify geographically.
