- Indian IT companies, including Infosys and Wipro, saw their shares jump for the fourth consecutive session, driving the Nifty IT index into the green. This surge is attributed to six key factors, including a sharp rise in Infosys's American Depository Receipt (ADR), soft US inflation data, increased hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts, strong Accenture results, value buying, and a depreciating rupee. Investors are showing renewed interest in the sector despite previous pressures from factors like H1-B visa changes.

- Infosys Limited's U.S.-listed ADRs experienced an unexplained surge and subsequent trading halts on December 19, 2025, which the company clarified was not due to any material events requiring disclosure. Analysts and commentators attribute the volatility to market-structure issues like short squeezes, thin liquidity, or data-feed errors rather than fundamental changes. The article also provides a comprehensive update on Infosys' recent fundamentals, corporate actions, and analyst forecasts ahead of its Q3 FY22 results on January 14, 2026.

- Infosys's shares rose by 3% on the BSE after its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) experienced a 40% surge on the NYSE, which the company clarified was not due to any material events. This volatility, including two trading halts, comes amid a broader rally in Indian IT stocks following strong Accenture results. Infosys reiterated its fiscal 2026 revenue growth guidance of 2% to 5% in local currency terms.

- Source: ts2.tech | 20251220T110940 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 63%
- Infosys Limited's U.S.-listed American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) experienced a sudden, unexplained spike of up to 56% on the NYSE on December 19, 2025, before trading was halted and the stock cooled. The company issued a clarification stating there were no undisclosed material developments, suggesting the event was technical or positional rather than fundamental. Analysts maintain a "Buy" rating for Infosys, with a focus on its long-term growth, resilient margins, and shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, especially as it approaches its Q3 FY26 earnings.

**5. Aramark (ARMK): Exploring Whether Steady Three‑Year Gains Still Leave Upside in the Valuation**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251221T150946 | Neutral | Relevance: 62%
- Aramark (ARMK) has shown steady market outperformance over three years, with a 31% total shareholder return, and sustained revenue and earnings growth. A narrative analysis suggests the stock is 14.9% undervalued, with a fair value of $44.60 due to margin expansion from tech investments. However, its current P/E ratio of 30.6x is higher than the industry average, implying the market may already be pricing in significant future growth, indicating a potential risk if earnings don't meet expectations.
