3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 3.62 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Forward P/E 172.4x stretched relative to 37% growth. Quality metrics strong (margin 28%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (6.4x), low leverage (D/E 0.22). Revenue growth strong at 41% YoY. Insider selling cluster ($16.8M in 90 days), potential headwind.

### Technicals

MRS_20 strengthening from -8.4% to -2.9% (+5.5% in 5 days), confirming momentum buildup. Below STRENGTH zone by 6.9pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 turning positive (1.4%) - potential reversal signal. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.21x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). RSI neutral at 48. Volume at 43% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | IGNITION (Zone D) | 1.20x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
