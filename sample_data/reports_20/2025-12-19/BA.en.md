**1. Boeing seeks FAA emissions waiver to sell 35 additional 777F freighters**

- Boeing has requested an FAA waiver for emissions rules to sell 35 more 777F freighters, citing strong customer demand and delays in its next-generation 777-8F's certification. The current emissions rules for large airplanes take effect in 2028, and Boeing's new freighter model won't be ready until after that date. The company argues that without the waiver, the U.S. could lose over $15 billion in export value as the 777F is the most fuel-efficient large widebody freighter in production essential for global freight.
