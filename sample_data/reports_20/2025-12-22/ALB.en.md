**1. Is Albemarle (ALB) Using Cesium Offtake Deals To Quietly Redefine Its Specialty Chemicals Edge?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251222T020753 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Albemarle (ALB) is adjusting its strategy by securing cesium concentrate offtake rights, in addition to its core lithium business, signaling a redefinition of its specialty chemicals focus. This move, alongside recent analyst optimism, positions the company amid industry volatility. While the long-term outlook for lithium and specialty chemicals is positive, investors should monitor the impact of prolonged low lithium prices on Albemarle's revenue and margins.

**2. The ALPS Clean Energy ETF Soared 30%, But Faces a 2026 Policy Cliff**
- Source: 24/7 Wall St. | 20251222T150948 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 65%
- The ALPS Clean Energy ETF (ACES) has surged 30% year-to-date in 2025 but still remains significantly below its 2020 peak, highlighting a recovery rally. A key concern is the June 30, 2026 deadline for clean energy tax credits under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which could accelerate near-term projects but also create long-term policy uncertainty. The article suggests that concentrated holdings in unprofitable companies like Albemarle and Rivian make ACES sensitive to market trends, and recommends the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) for investors seeking purer solar exposure without the volatility of lithium and EV components.
