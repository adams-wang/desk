**1. How Investors May Respond To Ameren (AEE) Adding Cybersecurity Veteran Jamie Engstrom To Its Board**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251220T022926 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Ameren Corporation has appointed Jamie L. Engstrom, a cybersecurity expert from Caterpillar, to its board of directors, effective January 1, 2026. This move highlights Ameren's focus on digital resilience and technology in its operations, complementing its existing investment narrative around grid modernization and clean energy. While Engstrom's expertise strengthens oversight of cyber risks, the article suggests it does not fundamentally alter the near-term focus on regulatory outcomes and potential risks like slower-than-planned data center demand, but underscores the importance of technological reliability.

- Georgia Power, a subsidiary of The Southern Company (SO), has received approval for a major electric generation expansion aimed at meeting the increasing demand from data centers, particularly those supporting artificial intelligence development. The plan, estimated to cost $16.3 billion but potentially $50-$60 billion for customers over time, intends to spread fixed costs across a broader customer base, with large users like data centers bearing a disproportionate share. Critics, however, express skepticism about demand forecasts and raise concerns about financial risks for existing customers and environmental impacts from new natural gas plants.

- The U.S. Senate confirmed four new members, including Alabamian Randall "Randy" Jones, to the Tennessee Valley Authority Board of Directors.
