- Oracle (ORCL) shares rose 0.4% in after-hours trading as 2026 market activity commenced, following a mixed start to the year for the broader market. Investors are focusing on Oracle's January 9th dividend record date and upcoming mid-March earnings, with the company's AI-driven cloud business remaining a key driver. Macro data, including January 9th U.S. jobs data, will also be critical in shaping market expectations for rate cuts and their impact on growth stocks.

- Mizuho has reiterated its Outperform rating and $400 price target for Oracle Corporation (ORCL) after the company's fiscal second-quarter results were described as mixed. While Oracle's Cloud segment performed largely as expected, there was a slight revenue miss due to licenses.

- Oracle (ORCL) stock closed lower in the final U.S. trading session of 2025 as tech stocks dipped, with investors focused on the company's data-center spending tied to AI-driven cloud demand. The year-end slide means Oracle begins 2026 with continued scrutiny on the cost of its AI push and the conversion of large cloud commitments into revenue, ahead of key macro data and its next earnings update in mid-March. The company's remaining performance obligations rose to $523 billion, while cloud revenue and cloud infrastructure revenue increased significantly.

**4. The Oracle Transfiguration: From Database Giant to AI Infrastructure Titan**
- Source: FinancialContent | 20260101T095400 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) has transformed from a traditional database company into a key architect of global AI infrastructure, driven by its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and focus on high-performance computing for AI. Despite a recent market correction and high capital expenditure, the company's multi-cloud strategy and "Stargate" venture position it for continued growth in the AI landscape. However, investors are closely watching OCI margins and debt levels as the company navigates fierce cloud competition and significant investments.

**5. Oracle stock slips into after-hours as tech fades on final day of 2025**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251231T221712 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Oracle shares declined about 1% in after-hours trading on the final day of 2025, mirroring a soft tech market. Investors are keenly observing Oracle's AI data-center spending and interest rate forecasts for 2026, especially as a recent SEC Form 4 revealed an executive sold 15,000 shares in late December. The company's significant capital expenditure projections for fiscal 2026, largely due to AI infrastructure, are creating investor scrutiny regarding profit conversion and free cash flow.
