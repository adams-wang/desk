- MSCI is contemplating the exclusion of companies with significant cryptocurrency holdings from its major indexes if digital assets constitute over 50% of their total assets, a move primarily targeting "digital asset treasury" firms like MicroStrategy (MSTR/Strategy). This potential reclassification is driven by concerns that these companies function more as investment funds than traditional operating businesses.
