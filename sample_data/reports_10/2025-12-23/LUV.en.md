- Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV) has announced a new partnership with Turkish Airlines, its sixth international collaboration in 2025. Starting January 2026, the deal will enable Southwest to connect U.S. passengers to Istanbul via 10 major international airports, facilitating trans-Atlantic travel.

- Southwest Airlines, previously known for its accommodating "Customer of Size" policy, will now require plus-size passengers to purchase a second seat if they cannot fit within a single seat's armrests. This change, effective January 27, 2026, marks a significant shift for the airline and is drawing criticism for imposing a "massive blow" and financial burden on plus-size travelers. Critics argue it could lead to discomfort for all passengers as some may try to avoid the extra cost by squeezing into a single seat.

- Morgan Stanley is evaluating the long-term viability of the low-cost and ultra-low-cost airline model, citing structural changes that are impacting earnings and competitive positioning. The brokerage suggests that consumer preferences for premium experiences have shifted, while cost inflation and operational constraints have disproportionately affected these carriers, narrowing their historical cost advantage. As a result, low-cost airlines like Southwest and JetBlue are adapting their business models by introducing premium options and loyalty programs, with 2026 expected to be a test year for the effectiveness of these changes.
