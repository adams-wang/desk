-  Comcast President Mike Cavanagh stated that while the company's bid for Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) had a low likelihood of success due to its lighter cash component, the process of exploring the acquisition made Comcast "better." He noted that the offer, focused on equity and substantial ownership in a combined entity, would have expanded Comcast's streaming ambitions globally.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
