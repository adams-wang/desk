- Netflix's potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and HBO Max streaming service is reportedly facing strong antitrust opposition from the Trump administration and the Justice Department. Officials are concerned that combining HBO Max's 100 million subscribers with Netflix's 300 million would create an entity double the size of its nearest competitor, Disney, and grant Netflix excessive pricing power over content and consumers. The DOJ likens the potential merger's anti-competitive impact to Ticketmaster controlling exclusive venues.

(NASDAQ:CDRO) after the company's third-quarter 2025 financial results showed flat net gaming revenue (NGR) but improved adjusted EBITDA. The online gaming operator demonstrated disciplined cost management despite challenges such as foreign exchange pressure in Mexico and regulatory uncertainty in Colombia.

Discovery’s film studio and HBO Max, expressing concerns that such a deal would concentrate excessive power and harm competition. The White House views a potential Netflix victory in the bidding war as a "red line" that would likely trigger a sweeping federal antitrust investigation, potentially blocking the deal and scrutinizing Netflix's overall market conduct.
