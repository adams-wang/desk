- The median employee pay at TJX and BJ's Wholesale Club is so low that their workers may qualify for SNAP benefits, highlighting a dependency on part-time labor to cut costs. This strategy is also linked to anti-union sentiments and disproportionately affects women and women of color, who make up a significant portion of these companies' low-wage, part-time workforce.
