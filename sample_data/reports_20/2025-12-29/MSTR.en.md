### Key Risks

1. High beta (3.41) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Valuation risk: PEG 3.1x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
3. Elevated short interest (10.9%): bears positioning against stock.
4. Long-term trend broken: trading 51.8% below SMA200.
5. Falling knife pattern: rapid decline without stabilization, catch risk elevated.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 deteriorating from -6.7% to -9.8% (-3.0% in 5 days), indicating relative weakness vs NASDAQ. Below STRENGTH zone by 13.8pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis).

MACD histogram positive (1.48), confirming momentum. Volume at 53% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: -SUL (Resistance).

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (HIGH) | 1.15x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with selective risk appetite and defensive rotation. VIX at 14.2 (2nd percentile) signals low volatility, while positive yield curve (+58bps) and stable economic indicators support continued expansion. Market breadth at 58.7% shows decent participation, but rotation into defensive names and Fed liquidity concerns warrant measured positioning.*
