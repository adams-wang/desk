- Source: ts2.tech | 20251223T011225 | Neutral | Relevance: 64%
- AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) experienced a slight dip in after-hours trading on December 22, 2025, after closing modestly higher in the regular session. This minor decline is attributed to investor positioning and low liquidity during the holiday-shortened week, rather than new fundamental signals. The primary focus for the stock remains the ongoing federal drug-pricing negotiations, particularly the “most-favored-nation” style pricing deals and the TrumpRx initiative, with AbbVie being one of the few remaining major drugmakers still in talks with the White House.
