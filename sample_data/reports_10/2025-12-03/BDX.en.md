- Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX) has underperformed the Nasdaq Composite, with its stock slipping 23% from its 52-week high and showing weaker gains over three months, YTD, and the past 52 weeks. Despite this, the company's Q4 results exceeded EPS expectations, and analysts maintain a "Moderate Buy" rating with a potential upside.

**5. There May Be Reason For Hope In Becton Dickinson's (NYSE:BDX) Disappointing Earnings**
- Source: Yahoo Finance Singapore | 20251203T140200 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 98%
- Becton Dickinson's recent weak earnings may be understated due to a significant impact from unusual items totalling US$1.3 billion, which are often one-off in nature. If these expenses don't recur, the company's profitability is expected to improve in the next year. The article suggests that Becton Dickinson's statutory profit likely understates its true earnings potential, especially given a 7.6% annual EPS growth over the last three years.

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
