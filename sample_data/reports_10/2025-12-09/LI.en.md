- Li Auto Inc. delivered 33,181 vehicles in November 2025 and reported a weaker Q4 outlook, prompting a strategic pivot towards new BEV models, software, and AI to revive growth and profitability. Investors need to assess whether these technology investments can offset softer demand and rising costs, especially given intensifying competition. The company's Q4 guidance projects a significant year-over-year drop in deliveries and revenue, highlighting the critical need for successful execution of its BEV and AI initiatives in 2026.
