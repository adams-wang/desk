**1. Is Edison’s Lowered 2025 EPS Guidance Amid Clean Energy Spend Altering The Investment Case For EIX?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251209T211642 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
-  Edison International recently cut its 2025 core EPS guidance due to higher interest expenses and significant clean energy investments, despite stronger-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS. This adjustment reinforces the short-term pressures on the company but does not fundamentally change its long-term investment narrative centered on grid and renewables investment supported by policy. Investors need to weigh elevated capital expenditures and balance sheet flexibility against ongoing decarbonization efforts and unresolved wildfire liabilities.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
