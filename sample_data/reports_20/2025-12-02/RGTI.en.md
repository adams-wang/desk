### Technicals

MRS_20 stable at -15.7% (minimal 5-day change). Below STRENGTH zone by 19.7pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). AM_20 at -14.3% indicates price below own 20MA trend. Underperforming sector by 15.1pp, stock-specific weakness. Long-term uptrend intact (above SMA200 at 1.31x) but short-term weakness (below SMA20). Volume at 50% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction.

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
