- Source: ts2.tech | 20251223T011225 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV) experienced a slight dip in after-hours trading on December 22, 2025, after closing modestly higher in the regular session. This minor decline is attributed to investor positioning and low liquidity during the holiday-shortened week, rather than new fundamental signals. The primary focus for the stock remains the ongoing federal drug-pricing negotiations, particularly the “most-favored-nation” style pricing deals and the TrumpRx initiative, with AbbVie being one of the few remaining major drugmakers still in talks with the White House.

**5. AbbVie Stock News Today (Dec. 22, 2025): ABBV Holds Near $227 as Drug-Pricing Talks, Dividend Growth, and 2026 Catalysts Come Into Focus**
- Source: ts2.tech | 20251222T170825 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) is trading near $227, facing policy risks from drug-pricing agreements while also benefiting from strong sales of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, a rising dividend, and a robust pipeline. The immediate focus for investors is on whether AbbVie will join the White House's "most-favored-nation" drug-pricing deals, as it remains one of the few major drugmakers not yet signed. Despite this uncertainty, the company's core immunology franchise and pipeline momentum, coupled with a recently increased quarterly dividend to $1.73, underpin its investment case.
