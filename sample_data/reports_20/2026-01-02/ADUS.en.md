**1. Earnings Are Growing at Addus HomeCare (NASDAQ:ADUS) but Shareholders Still Don't Like Its Prospects**

- Addus HomeCare (NASDAQ:ADUS) saw its share price decline by 14% over the last year, underperforming the broader market despite a 6.8% improvement in earnings per share (EPS). This suggests that the market's reaction to the company might be tied to unreasonable past growth expectations rather than current fundamentals. While revenue has grown, the disconnect between EPS growth and share price decline indicates a potential opportunity if the market has overreacted.
