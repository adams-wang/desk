**3. Fair Isaac (FICO): Valuation Check After Strong Q4 Earnings Beat and Scores Revenue Growth**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251205T222904 | Bullish | Relevance: 99%
-  Fair Isaac (FICO) reported a strong fourth quarter with impressive scores revenue growth and adjusted earnings exceeding Wall Street estimates, leading to a recent rally after a volatile year. Despite being down over 12 months, the stock is trading about 13% below analyst targets, suggesting a potential undervaluation based on a narrative fair value of $2,031.78.

**4. Can FICO Stock Rebound From Here?**

-  FICO stock is currently trading within a historically reliable support zone between $1,683 and $1,860, which has previously led to significant rebounds, with an average peak gain of 22.8%. Strong fundamentals, impressive Q4 FY25 earnings, and solid FY26 guidance, driven by its Scores segment and FICO Score 10T adoption, suggest a high probability of another rebound, despite potential challenges from increased competition and high valuations. However, the stock is not immune to significant downturns during market volatility, as evidenced by past major drops.
