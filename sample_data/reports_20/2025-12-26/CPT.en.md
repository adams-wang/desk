### Key Risks

1. Volume divergence: price rising (+0.5% MRS) on declining volume (50% of avg) suggests distribution.
2. Valuation stretched: PEG 9.0x requires aggressive growth execution.
3. Market regime shift could impact momentum names disproportionately.

### Catalysts

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Technicals

MRS_20 stable at 3.0% (minimal 5-day change). Below STRENGTH zone by 1.0pp (needs >4.0% for momentum thesis). MRS_5 at 0.5% confirms short-term momentum alignment. AM_20 at 3.9% shows strong absolute momentum above own 20MA. Outperforming sector by 3.5pp, stock-specific strength. Below SMA200 (0.99x), long-term trend not supportive. Volume at 50% of 20MA suggests lack of conviction. OFD pattern: +SLL (Support).
