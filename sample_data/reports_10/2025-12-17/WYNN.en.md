- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T090830 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Wynn Resorts received a "Conviction Buy" upgrade from Goldman Sachs due to strong Las Vegas performance and improving Macau trends. While a narrative valuation suggests upside with a fair value of $143.33, a discounted cash flow (DCF) model indicates the stock might be overvalued at $95 compared to its current price of $126.04. The article discusses this valuation discrepancy and potential risks, highlighting the imminent launch of Wynn Al Marjan Island as a key catalyst.

The analysts anticipate that the license and management fees will directly fuel shareholder returns and view the project favorably due to its market potential and expected exclusive casino license for multiple years, catering to gaming and non-gaming consumers. The project, with a US$5.1-billion budget, aims for a Q1 2027 opening and is expected to generate at least US$465 million in annual adjusted property EBITDA, with Wynn Resorts receiving management, license fees, and a share of free cash flow.
