**2. Amprius Technologies (NYSE:AMPX) Trading Down 4.2% - Here's Why**
- Source: MarketBeat | 20251229T220910 | Somewhat-Bearish | Relevance: 100%
- Amprius Technologies (NYSE:AMPX) saw its stock price drop 4.2% in recent trading, despite an earnings beat and revenue exceeding expectations. Analyst sentiment remains largely positive with a "Moderate Buy" consensus and a $14.57 average price target, suggesting significant upside. However, insider selling, including a large sale by the CEO, and the company's unprofitability with a -53% net margin are noted concerns.

**3. Why We're Not Concerned Yet About Amprius Technologies, Inc.'s (NYSE:AMPX) 27% Share Price Plunge**
- Source: 富途牛牛 | 20251228T180904 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Amprius Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:AMPX) has seen a 27% share price drop in the last month, yet its stock has still soared 250% over the past year. Despite a high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 18.5x compared to the industry average, the company's strong revenue growth of 234% last year and an anticipated 83% annual growth for the next three years (versus the industry's 16%) provide a rational basis for investor confidence. Therefore, despite the recent plunge, the high P/S ratio and robust future revenue forecasts suggest underlying strength.
