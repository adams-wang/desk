- Infosys is experiencing significant call option activity for the December 2025 expiry, particularly at the ₹1680 strike price, indicating market interest in bullish positioning despite recent price declines. This suggests traders anticipate an upward movement in the stock to surpass ₹1680, supported by the stock trading above its key moving averages.
