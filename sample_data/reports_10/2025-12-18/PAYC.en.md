**1. Paycom (PAYC) Stock Is Up, What You Need To Know**
- Source: TradingView — Track All Markets | 20251217T180827 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Shares of HR software provider Paycom (PAYC) jumped after BTIG initiated coverage with a "Buy" rating and a $195 price target.

- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251216T103424 | Neutral | Relevance: 100%
- Paycom (PAYC) is under renewed scrutiny after reporting mixed Q3 results, which saw earnings per share fall short while revenue exceeded forecasts. Despite the recent CFO share sale and a nearly 30% drop in share price over the past year, the company is considered "22.4% Undervalued" by Simply Wall St, with a narrative fair value near $209.94.
