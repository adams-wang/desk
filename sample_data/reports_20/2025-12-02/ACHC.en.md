**1. Acadia Healthcare Updates PLGL Reserves Following Annual Actuarial Review, Lowers 2025 Guidance**
- Source: Yahoo Finance | 20251202T160500 | Neutral | Relevance: 97%
- Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. announced an update to its professional and general liability (PLGL) reserves after its annual actuarial review, leading to a reduction in its full-year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share guidance. The revised projections are primarily due to higher expected settlement costs for patient-related litigation, a significant increase in claim frequency, and less favorable reinsurance terms. The company anticipates a substantial increase in its net PLGL liability by the end of 2025 and provided initial guidance for 2026 PLGL expenses.

*NORMAL regime with moderate improvement trajectory. VIX compression from 20.5 to 16.6 over 5 days signals declining fear, while 47% breadth shows narrow but recovering participation. Fed meeting in 6 days creates near-term uncertainty, but AI sector momentum and improving technical setups support selective positioning.*
