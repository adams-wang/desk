- SL Green Realty reported significant Manhattan office leasing in 2025, signaling strong momentum.

**5. Macerich (MAC): Exploring Whether Recent Multi‑Year Rebound Still Leaves the REIT Undervalued**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251217T093303 | Neutral | Relevance: 62%
- Macerich (MAC) has experienced a significant rebound, with its stock climbing 6% in the past month and achieving over 80% total shareholder returns over three to five years, despite a recent 1-day dip. While a narrative places its fair value at $19.53, suggesting it's undervalued due to its focus on experiential retail, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model indicates a much stronger undervaluation, with an estimated fair value of $31, implying investors may be underestimating its earning potential. However, high leverage and exposure to challenging mall markets pose risks to its valuation upside.
