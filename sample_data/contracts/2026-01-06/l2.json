  "cycle_reasoning": "Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) in Momentum Zone F signal early-cycle expansion with strong cyclical leadership.

This pattern matches classic early expansion characteristics with 5+ sectors aligned.",
  "rotation_analysis": "The market is executing a textbook early expansion rotation with Materials (XLB, +4.07% MRS_20) and Industrials (XLI, +2.81% MRS_20) in Momentum Zone F, supported by Financials and Healthcare in sustained uptrends. This four-sector leadership cluster (36% of market) provides strong conviction for cycle phase classification.\n\nThe NEUTRAL rotation bias (despite RISK_ON regime) reflects a balanced mix: 2 offensive momentum leaders (XLB, XLI), 2 quality growth trends (XLF, XLV), and 5 sectors in consolidation. Energy's weakening (Zone B) despite positive news on AI power demand and OPEC+ cuts is notable\u2014suggesting profit-taking after early-2026 rally rather than fundamental deterioration.\n\nMost significant is Consumer Staples (XLP) in toxic Zone C with -1.53% MRS_20, classic early expansion behavior as investors rotate from safety to growth. The paradox of XLP's strong +0.310 news sentiment (highest of all sectors) versus worst technical performance highlights how cycle rotation trumps individual catalysts. LOW rotation velocity (\u22643 sectors transitioning) indicates this is an established trend, not a whipsaw.\n\nTechnology's consolidation in Zone E (+0.37% MRS_20) despite explosive AI storage news (WDC +17%) suggests digestion after prior leadership\u2014watching for either breakout to Zone A or breakdown. Communication Services' sharp deterioration (ROC_3 -1.94%) despite positive themes indicates mega-cap tech profit-taking within the sector.",
  "l1_alignment": "L2 sector rotation FULLY ALIGNS with L1's RISK_ON (STABLE) regime and AGGRESSIVE bias. The offensive cyclical leadership (Materials/Industrials in Momentum) combined with defensive sector weakness (Staples toxic, Utilities/Energy underperforming) confirms healthy risk appetite. \n\nL1's VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) and 63.5% breadth supports the cyclical rotation we're seeing. However, L1's elevated put/call ratio warning about \"smart money hedging\" is worth monitoring\u2014if we see Materials/Industrials momentum stall or Technology break down from Zone E, that would be early warning of regime shift.\n\nThe 110% max position size from L1 is appropriate given our 4 bullish sectors (XLB, XLI, XLF, XLV) all showing stable momentum with LOW rotation velocity. No conflict resolution needed\u2014macro regime and sector rotation are mutually reinforcing. The AI/semiconductor theme cited in L1 manifests in our sector data through Tech news (WDC storage rally) but interestingly drives Materials/Industrials price action more than Tech itself, validating the broadening of AI benefits beyond mega-cap.",
  "key_insight": "The market is in a high-conviction early expansion cycle where cyclical sectors (Materials +4.07%, Industrials +2.81%) are in momentum while defensive Staples are toxic (-1.53%)\u2014but the critical insight is that Technology sits in neutral consolidation (+0.37%) despite explosive AI news, suggesting the AI theme is now driving traditional industrial capex rather than just tech stocks, which validates a sustainable broadening of the rally beyond mega-cap concentration.",

  "reasoning": "Cycle Phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (HIGH confidence)\n\n=== 4-STEP REASONING AUDIT ===\n\nStep 1 - L1 Alignment:\nL1 regime: RISK_ON (STABLE) with AGGRESSIVE bias, VIX 6th percentile, 63.5% breadth. No hard blocks. Rotation fully aligns\u2014cyclical momentum (XLB/XLI) and defensive weakness (XLP toxic) confirm risk appetite. Elevated put/call ratio noted but not yet impacting sector flows.\n\nStep 2 - Signal Validation:\nAll pre-calculated signals validated against thresholds. Zone F (Momentum): XLB MRS_20=+4.07% (>2.8%), XLI +2.81% (>2.8%), both MRS_5 positive \u2713. Zone A (Trend): XLF +2.02%, XLV +1.67% (0.5-2.8% range), both MRS_5 positive \u2713. Zone C (Toxic): XLP -1.53% (<-3.5% threshold NOT met, but -1.53% with MRS_5 -1.02% qualifies for AVOID per v7.0 rules). Zone B (Weakening): XLE MRS_20 +0.96% but MRS_5 -0.63% \u2713. No anomalies detected.\n\nStep 3 - Zone Analysis:\nActive zones: F (XLB, XLI - offensive momentum), A (XLF, XLV - quality growth), E (XLK, XLY, XLRE, XLU, XLC - consolidation cluster), B (XLE - weakening), C (XLP - avoid). Rotation direction: OUT of defensives (XLP, XLU) INTO cyclicals (XLB, XLI) with Financials/Healthcare providing stability. Zone E cluster (5 sectors) represents digestion/decision zone\u2014watching for breakouts to A/F or breakdowns to C.\n\nStep 4 - Conflict Resolution:\nNo L1 vs L2 conflict\u2014both indicate risk-on environment. Apparent paradox: XLP has strongest news sentiment (+0.310) but worst technical performance (Zone C, -1.53%). Resolution: News articles include cyclical consumer names (Cinemark entertainment, Dollar Tree retail) not true defensive staples, while sector ETF XLP weighted to food/household products facing rotation selling. This validates cycle phase over stock-specific catalysts. Energy weakening (Zone B) despite positive AI power/OPEC+ news resolved by profit-taking after early-2026 rally mentioned in XLE news context.\n\n=== ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ===\n\nCycle Reasoning:\nMaterials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) in Momentum Zone F signal early-cycle expansion with strong cyclical leadership. Financials (XLF) and Healthcare (XLV) in Trend Zone A provide breadth confirmation. Energy (XLE) weakening and Staples (XLP) in toxic zone further validate cyclical rotation away from defensives. This pattern matches classic early expansion characteristics with 5+ sectors aligned.\n\nKey Insight: The market is in a high-conviction early expansion cycle where cyclical sectors (Materials +4.07%, Industrials +2.81%) are in momentum while defensive Staples are toxic (-1.53%)\u2014but the critical insight is that Technology sits in neutral consolidation (+0.37%) despite explosive AI news, suggesting the AI theme is now driving traditional industrial capex rather than just tech stocks, which validates a sustainable broadening of the rally beyond mega-cap concentration."
