-  Barclays Capital has lowered its 12-month price target for Oracle Corp. (ORCL) from $400 to $330, citing growing investor apprehension about a potential "AI bubble" and concerns over long-term funding risks for the sector. Despite Oracle's progress in cloud infrastructure and AI workloads, Barclays indicates that recent rapid AI-infrastructure spending is raising questions about demand sustainability and potential oversupply. The firm suggests a more measured outlook on AI investment cycles and cloud-infrastructure normalization will likely lead to near-term volatility for Oracle's stock.
