2. Valuation risk: PEG 3.1x with declining EPS estimates leaves no margin for error.
3. Elevated short interest (10.9%): bears positioning against stock.
4. Long-term trend broken: trading 52.6% below SMA200.
5. Falling knife pattern: rapid decline without stabilization, catch risk elevated.

- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.
- Year-end positioning and window dressing may support price.

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.20x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with mixed signals requiring caution. VIX at 14.95 suggests calm markets, but record repo borrowing and narrowing breadth (51.4%) indicate stress beneath the surface. Positive yield curve (+62bps) and stable economic data support risk assets, but year-end dynamics mask true liquidity conditions.*
