The order prohibits the defendants from recruiting current Brown & Brown employees or soliciting its insurance customers. The defendants deny wrongdoing, claiming employees left due to a "toxic" corporate climate and below-market pay at Brown & Brown.

|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | RISK_ON (MEDIUM) | 1.10x |
| L2 Sector | TREND (Zone A) | 1.20x |

*RISK_ON regime with strong participation and low volatility. VIX at 14.75 (6th percentile) with breadth at 63.5% signals healthy risk appetite. Fed dovish expectations and AI/semiconductor momentum are primary drivers, though elevated put/call ratio suggests smart money hedging. Focus on quality growth with awareness of potential complacency.*
