- Source: Sahm | 20251210T000822 | Neutral | Relevance: 99%
-  Short interest in CME Group Inc. (NYSE: CME) has increased by 31.58% since its last report, with 5.41 million shares now sold short, representing 1.5% of its float. This rise in short interest signals a more bearish sentiment among investors, though it doesn't guarantee a near-term stock decline.

**2. CME Group fines Citigroup Global Markets for alleged CBOT rule violation**
- Source: FX News Group | 20251211T053935 | Neutral | Relevance: 84%
- The CME Group has fined Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI) $150,000 for allegedly violating Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) Rule 930.K.

CGMI neither admitted nor denied the rule violation as part of the settlement.

**3. Federal Reserve’s Dovish Shift Boosts Prospects for Infrastructure Capital’s BNDS ETF**
- Source: citybuzz | 20251211T200944 | Neutral | Relevance: 72%
-  The Federal Reserve has adopted a more dovish monetary policy stance, significantly increasing the probability of a 25-basis-point rate reduction in December. This shift, influenced by key policymakers downplaying inflation and highlighting employment risks, is expected to benefit Infrastructure Capital’s BNDS ETF, an actively managed fund focused on fixed-income securities. A rate cut would make the BNDS ETF's higher yields more attractive to investors seeking managed risk.

- Source: Finviz | 20251209T060955 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 72%
-  The Nasdaq and S&P 500 ended their five-session winning streaks, closing lower as rising bond yields and impending Fed meeting jitters cooled market sentiment.
