- Source: FinancialContent | 20260102T172100 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRSN) is scheduled to release its Q4 and full-year 2025 financial results on February 5, 2026. The market is keenly focused on whether the company will implement its contractually permitted 7% annual price increase for .com domains starting in 2026, which would significantly impact its valuation and the broader web-enablement sector. The upcoming earnings call will also address VeriSign's strategy amidst increased regulatory scrutiny and the impending 2026 ICANN new gTLD application round.

**2. Verisign: short sellers were wrong**
- Source: Domain Name Wire | 20251231T170627 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Verisign (NASDAQ: VRSN) has stated that data indicates short sellers were incorrect about the impact of Google AdSense for Domains (AFD) program termination on .com registrations. Despite initial concerns raised by short sellers, Verisign calculated that only 2% of its domain base was parked for monetization, and recent data shows no significant change in .com domain deletions. While AFD's closure affects some new top-level domains and potentially registrar pricing, Verisign's assessment appears to be more accurate than the short sellers' predictions.
