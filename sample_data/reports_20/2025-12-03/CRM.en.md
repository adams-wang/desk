- Source: ts2.tech | 20251203T190628 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Salesforce (CRM) is facing a critical earnings report on December 3, 2025, with its stock down almost 30% year-to-date despite analyst targets implying significant upside. Investors are focused on whether Salesforce's AI transformation, particularly with Agentforce and Data Cloud, can drive renewed growth and justify its valuation as it transitions from a high-growth stock to a more value-oriented company with strong profitability. The Q3 FY26 results will be a key indicator of the company's progress on its long-term roadmap towards $60 billion in revenue by FY2030 and a return to double-digit growth.

- Salesforce Inc. reported mixed Q3 financial results with earnings beating estimates but revenue falling slightly short. The company's stock rose in late trading due to positive momentum in its agentic artificial intelligence initiatives, specifically the Agentforce platform, which has achieved $540 million in annual recurring revenue. Despite some promising AI growth drivers, overall revenue growth remains sluggish, and the company's full-year guidance indicates that immediate growth will still be modest, with a significant portion expected from its recent acquisition of Informatica.
