-  The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) failed to approve DTE Energy's power contracts for the Oracle and Open AI data center by the utility's December 5th deadline, despite DTE's warning of project cancellation if not met. DTE declined to comment on the project's status post-deadline, while the MPSC cited that cases are added to the agenda when "ripe for a decision." This inaction has caused further controversy around the massive $7 billion data center project, which faces significant public opposition and calls for a contested case due to concerns about energy costs, environmental impact, and transparency.

-  A letter to the editor criticizes the lack of transparency from DTE Energy Co. and developer Related Companies regarding a proposed hyperscaler data center in Saline Township. The author, a former Michigan Strategic Fund board member, expresses skepticism about the promised economic benefits and job creation, particularly given DTE's history and the highly redacted contract details. The op-ed urges for greater transparency and stronger commitments to benefit Michiganders, questioning if the state will be left to bear the costs if the AI bubble bursts.

The brokerage increased its price target to $150 and expects an 8.1% EPS compound annual growth rate for 2026-2030, driven by the addition of 1.5 gigawatts of data center load to its model. DTE's shares are currently trading at a discount compared to peers, presenting an attractive entry point according to Jefferies.
