- Georgia Power, a subsidiary of The Southern Company (SO), has received approval for a major electric generation expansion aimed at meeting the increasing demand from data centers, particularly those supporting artificial intelligence development. The plan, estimated to cost $16.3 billion but potentially $50-$60 billion for customers over time, intends to spread fixed costs across a broader customer base, with large users like data centers bearing a disproportionate share. Critics, however, express skepticism about demand forecasts and raise concerns about financial risks for existing customers and environmental impacts from new natural gas plants.

- Georgia regulators have unanimously approved a massive expansion of the state's power grid, including nearly 10,000 megawatts of new energy capacity, largely to serve growing data center demand. This plan, spearheaded by Georgia Power, relies heavily on new natural gas infrastructure and has sparked debate over potential financial risks to ratepayers and transparency concerning promised residential rate reductions. Critics, including environmental and consumer advocacy groups, expressed concerns that the costs of this expansion could fall on everyday Georgians if the forecasted demand from data centers does not materialize.
