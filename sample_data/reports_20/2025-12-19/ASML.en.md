**1. ASML: The Reports of My Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated; Wide Moat Intact**
- Source: Morningstar Canada | 20251219T140842 | Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- Morningstar maintains its wide moat rating and €850 fair value estimate for ASML, despite reports of Chinese scientists building a prototype extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light machine. The article argues that converting laboratory-scale EUV technology into an economically viable manufacturing process takes years due to the immense complexity of ASML's machines and supply chain. Furthermore, ASML's key clients are not geopolitically aligned with China, and China is expected to represent a declining percentage of ASML's revenue over time.

- Analysts, including Goldman Sachs and Cantor Fitzgerald, maintain a "Buy" rating on ASML stock due to strong demand for its lithography systems driven by the memory market and AI infrastructure build-out, with multiple catalysts expected in 2026. Despite a recent 4-5% dip from profit-taking, the stock's long-term outlook remains positive, and analysts' consensus price targets are above current levels. The dip is seen as a consolidation rather than a fundamental shift in the company's strong market position.
