**1. Is CRISPR Therapeutics a Buy, Sell, or Hold in 2026?**
- Source: Finviz | 20251219T120917 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has seen volatile performance but holds potential due to its approved gene-editing treatment, Casgevy, despite currently unimpressive sales and financial losses. Its partner, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), forecasts significant growth for Casgevy in 2026, which could improve CRISPR's financials. With a strong balance sheet and an approved therapy, CRISPR is considered a buy for long-term investment or a potential acquisition target.

**2. CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP): Reassessing Valuation After a 13% Pullback and Strong Year‑to‑Date Gains**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251218T223953 | Somewhat-Bullish | Relevance: 100%
- CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) has experienced a 13% pullback recently, prompting a re-evaluation of its stock despite strong year-to-date gains of over 32%. The company's price-to-book ratio of 2.7x suggests it's fairly valued compared to peers, but a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model indicates a potentially higher fair value of $125.93 against its current $54.74. Investors are left to consider whether the market has fully priced in its gene-editing pipeline and CASGEVY rollout or if it remains undervalued.
