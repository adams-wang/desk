- Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is showing strong signs of recovery with its stock surging toward $30, driven by the strategic $10 billion Metsera acquisition that positions it in the lucrative obesity drug market, and an aggressive $7.2 billion cost-cutting program. Despite a significant drop from its pandemic peak, the company's Q3 2025 results and core oncology products demonstrate robust operational efficiency and a clear path to long-term growth, supported by a strong dividend yield and undervalued multiples. The firm expects to mitigate upcoming revenue losses from patent expirations with new blockbusters and diversified revenue streams.

- Pfizer's valuation is under scrutiny following FDA approval of its PADCEV combination with pembrolizumab for bladder cancer, enhancing its oncology pipeline and revenue potential. Despite a robust 1-year total shareholder return of 5.3%, the stock is still recovering from a challenging three-year period, with its fair value estimated at $29.08, suggesting it is currently undervalued.
