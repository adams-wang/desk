-  Wolfe Research upgraded Waters Corp. (NYSE:WAT) to Outperform with a $480.00 price target, citing above-average core growth potential, an attractive free cash flow profile, and strong management. Despite potential near-term premium degradation from the BD Life Sciences integration, Wolfe Research believes Waters shares are undervalued due to the company's attractive end market and strong financial prospects. This upgrade follows strong Q3 2025 results that surpassed analyst expectations, leading to adjusted price targets from other investment firms.

-  Jefferies has increased its price target for Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) to $220 from $215, maintaining a Buy rating, due to implications from its transaction with Waters Corporation. The firm notes that investors are "warming up" to the Waters story, supporting Becton Dickinson's stock, and that the "New BD" remaining business appears to be trading at a "relatively cheap pro forma valuation." This adjustment precedes a webinar to discuss the tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust structure.

*NORMAL regime with signs of improving risk appetite. Multiple major banks lowering prime rates suggest a dovish tilt in financial conditions ahead of the FOMC, while volatility remains subdued and breadth is moderate. Key drivers are easing lending rates, stable macro data, and improving sentiment, but selectivity is needed due to sector divergences.*
