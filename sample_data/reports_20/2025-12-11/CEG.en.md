- The U.S. Energy Department has selected TVA and Holtec to develop two new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), with a total investment of $800 million. This initiative, backed by the Trump administration, aims to boost America's nuclear energy capacity to compete with China and support growing AI-driven energy needs. The grants include $400 million for TVA to build a BWRX-300 reactor and funds for Holtec to transition into an SMR operator.

**4. QQMG: ESG Alternative To QQQ With Stronger Performance But Higher Risks**
- Source: Seeking Alpha | 20251209T113900 | Neutral | Relevance: 63%
-  The Invesco ESG NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQMG) is presented as an ESG-screened alternative to the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF. While QQMG has shown stronger performance since its inception in 2021, mainly due to a larger allocation to IT, it also carries higher valuation risk, volatility, and imperfect liquidity. The author initiates coverage with a Hold rating, suggesting it's a solid option for ESG-conscious investors despite the elevated risks compared to QQQ.

**5. Is Edison’s Lowered 2025 EPS Guidance Amid Clean Energy Spend Altering The Investment Case For EIX?**
- Source: Simply Wall Street | 20251209T211642 | Neutral | Relevance: 60%
-  Edison International recently cut its 2025 core EPS guidance due to higher interest expenses and significant clean energy investments, despite stronger-than-expected Q3 adjusted EPS. This adjustment reinforces the short-term pressures on the company but does not fundamentally change its long-term investment narrative centered on grid and renewables investment supported by policy. Investors need to weigh elevated capital expenditures and balance sheet flexibility against ongoing decarbonization efforts and unresolved wildfire liabilities.
