- Source: Stock Titan | 20251209T150939 | Bullish | Relevance: 99%
-  Jazz Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: JAZZ) presented 20 abstracts at World Sleep 2025 and Psych Congress 2025, including Phase 4 DUET data for Xywav (low-sodium oxybate). Key findings indicated that DUET led to fewer awakenings, reduced wake after sleep onset, decreased sleep inertia, and improved objective alertness in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia, with additional symptom benefits observed in a higher-dose cohort. Real-world analyses also highlighted elevated sodium-associated cardiovascular, cardiometabolic, and renal risks in people with narcolepsy or IH, reinforcing the need for low-sodium treatments.
