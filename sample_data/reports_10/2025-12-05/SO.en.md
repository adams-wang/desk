### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 1.00x |
| L2 Sector | TOXIC (Zone G) | 0.25x |

*NORMAL regime with stabilizing volatility and moderate risk appetite. Fed in data-dependent mode with 7 days to FOMC—soft economic data (retail -4.67% MoM, CPI 2.89% rising) offsetting labor resilience. AI infrastructure demand and capital reallocation themes dominating corporate narratives, signaling selective risk-on in growth/tech segments. Narrow breadth (52% above 50MA) and neutral put/call suggest complacency but not excess—standard late-cycle positioning amid policy uncertainty.*
