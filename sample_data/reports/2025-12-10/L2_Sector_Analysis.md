## Sector Analysis

### Executive Summary
Cycle phase: EARLY_EXPANSION (HIGH confidence). Rotation bias: NEUTRAL. Key insight: The market is transitioning from defensive positioning to early cycle risk-taking, with cyclical sectors (Materials, Energy) breaking out of underperformance zones just as banks proactively cut prime rates ahead of FOMC - creating a powerful setup for continued cyclical leadership if the dovish pivot materializes.

### Market Narrative
- Basic Materials: commodity price stabilization, infrastructure spending, dovish rate environment.
- Energy: oil price stability, OPEC+ production discipline, refining margins.
- Technology: AI infrastructure spending, cloud growth, semiconductor demand, rate sensitivity.
- Weakness in Consumer Defensive, Healthcare, Real Estate: margin pressure, private label competition, consumer trade-down, inventory management; drug pricing pressures, regulatory uncertainty, Medicare negotiations, biotech funding.

### Rotation Summary
The market is exhibiting classic early expansion characteristics with cyclical sectors breaking out of underperformance zones. Materials (XLB) and Energy (XLE) are both showing IGNITION signals from Zone D, indicating capital flow into beaten-down cyclicals as risk appetite improves. Technology (XLK) maintains its leadership position in Zone A with sustained uptrend momentum, benefiting from both AI themes and rate sensitivity. The middle tier shows neutral positioning across Industrials, Consumer Cyclical, Financials, and Communication Services, suggesting selective stock-picking environments in these sectors. The defensive complex is experiencing broad-based outflows, with Utilities in toxic territory (-5.51% MRS_20) and Healthcare, Real Estate, and Consumer Staples all in avoid status. This rotation pattern strongly supports the early expansion cycle classification.

### L1 Alignment
Perfect alignment between L1 NORMAL regime with improving risk appetite and L2 sector rotation. The AGGRESSIVE position bias from L1 supports the cyclical breakouts we're seeing in XLB and XLE, while XLK's continued leadership aligns with the improving sentiment. Defensive sector weakness (XLU, XLV, XLRE, XLP) confirms the rotation away from safety trades that characterizes the transition from defensive to risk-on positioning.
