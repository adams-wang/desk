### Key Risks

1. High beta (4.25) amplifies market volatility - any risk-off move could trigger sharp selloff.
2. Premium valuation (P/E 61x, PEG 2.8x) vulnerable to multiple compression.
3. Elevated short interest (9.6%): bears positioning against stock.
4. Near-term weakness: 9.3% below SMA50 despite long-term uptrend.

### Catalysts

- Momentum building: MRS_10 improving +5.6% over 5 days suggests accumulation.
- Broader market risk-on sentiment could lift quality names.

### Fundamentals

PEG ratio 2.75 signals overvaluation risk, limited margin of safety. Quality metrics strong (margin 19%). Balance sheet: strong liquidity (5.6x), low leverage (D/E 0.31).

### Market Context

| Layer | Signal | Modifier |
|-------|--------|----------|
| L1 Macro | NORMAL (MEDIUM) | 0.95x |
| L2 Sector | NEUTRAL (Zone E) | 1.00x |

*NORMAL regime with moderate risk appetite. VIX at 16 is below median, showing calm, but breadth is only moderate and put/call is neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor defensive extremes. Key drivers are rising Fed rate-cut odds from soft ADP jobs data, mixed earnings across sectors, and ongoing AI/tech strength offset by caution in cyclicals and banks. Positioning should remain selective and neutral, awaiting more decisive macro or earnings signals.*
