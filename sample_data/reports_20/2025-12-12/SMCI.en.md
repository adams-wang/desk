The stock's decline can be attributed to a cooled "AI trade" following updates from Oracle and Broadcom, with investors questioning AI spending and profitability. Despite analyst price targets remaining above the current share price, sentiment is mixed due to concerns over margins, reporting quality, and execution, especially given the company's ambitious Q2 FY2026 revenue guidance.

- Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) stock has dropped to around $34, down 40% from its 2025 peak, reflecting investor skepticism due to repeated earnings misses and gross-margin compression, despite strong AI-server demand.
