- Uber shares experienced a 1.9% decline after Melius Research downgraded the stock to "Sell" with a $73 price target, citing increasing autonomous vehicle (AV) competition expected in 2026 and beyond. Melius warned that intensified AV competition could negatively impact Uber's returns and pricing power, even with the company's strategic partnerships.

- Uber is expected to be in the spotlight on Monday following a report that it restructured UK driver contracts outside London to reduce exposure to a new 20% VAT on minicab fares. This move, which shifts Uber's role to an agent rather than a transport service supplier in those areas, could significantly cut its VAT liability and prevent a 20% fare increase. Investors are now watching upcoming US economic data and Uber's next earnings report expected in early February, as the stock has shown sensitivity to headline risks and macro backdrops.
